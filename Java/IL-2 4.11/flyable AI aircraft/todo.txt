This is going to be a longer one and mostly not related to 4.11 directly, but as there is no other bug report thread I will post it here.

As we all are now required to fly with more attention to our engines and temperatures,
I noticed some things with instruments whereupon I (briefly) checked all cockpits.

The results:

A20:
- Carb Air Temp needles are free floating in the instruments (no attachment to a shaft)

F4F / Fm2:
- Oil Pressure runs counter clockwise
- Fuel Pressure remains low

F6F:
- Underbelly cowl flap "opens" to the inside
- Fuel Pressure gauge works as fuel quantity gauge (on that note I didn't find a dedicated fuel gauge)
- Oil Pressure goes off the limit all the way to maximum indicatable by the instrument

I-250:
- Free floating needles for Oil and Coolant Temperatures
- Oxigen Quantity needle missing

IL-10:
- Oil and Coolant Temperature needles free floating

P-38:
- Fuel needles flicker against each other when overlapping

P-51:
- Free floating RPM needle
- Compass needles flicker against each other when overlapping
- Altimeter needles free floating
- Carb Air Temp needle free floating

Pe-2 (110 + 350) + Pe-3 bis:
- Missing needle for Air Pressure

SBD:
- Oil and Fuel Pressure too high

Yak:
- Fuel Pressure needle low and not moving when engine runs
- (Yak-1B only) Fuel Pressure needle on the wrond side (ccw)

A6M:
- Fuel Pressure needle not moving when engine runs
- Oil Pressure goes all the way to max indicatable
- Oxygen Quantity 0 (maybe intended this way)

Bf109:
- Fuel Pressure low and not moving when engine runs

D3A:
- Fuel Pressure low and not moving when engine runs
- Oil Pressure goes all the way to max indicatable
- Orange lever to the left is translucent from the top, looks like its placed upside down, the bottom wouldn't matter to be translucent

Fw190:
- Fuel Pressure low and not moving when engine runs
- (A-4, -5, -6) MG warning lights are lit until nose ammo is empty (maybe correct, but in my eyes a warning light should indicate the other way around)

He111:
- Fuel Pressure low and not moving when engines run
- Oil Pressure goes all the way to max indicatable
- Bombsight elevation indicator on the LotFe runs the wrong direction (indicates 60° when bombsight actually faces straight downwards)

Hurricane Mk.I:
- No needle for Oil pressure
- Fuel Pressure moves with boost (maybe intended this way)

Ju87:
- Fuel Pressure low and not moving when engine runs

Ju88:
- Oil Pressure goes all the way to max indicatable

Mc202:
- Manifold Pressure needle rotates aroung the wrong axis (Y axis instead of Z axis (Z pointing out the instrument))

Ta152:
- Fuel Pressure low and not moving when engine runs


It may be quite likely that I simply misunderstand how some instruments work or what they are supposed to indicate (quantity wise).
Or if some things fall under the advise "please don't go by cockpit gauges, they aren't always accurate".
Please correct me if things in here are wrong either way !

Good day everyone !
