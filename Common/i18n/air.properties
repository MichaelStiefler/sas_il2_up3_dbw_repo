A-20DB7             \n    A-20C, 1941\n\nType: Light Bomber / Attack\n\nWeight:\nEmpty: 5,330 kg\nTake-off: 7,700 kg\nMaximum: 10,660 kg\n\nLength: 14.5 m\nWingspan: 18.7 m\nWing area: 43.2 sq m\n\nEngine: 2 \u0425 Wright SC3G\nPower: 1,100 HP at sea level\n\nTop speed:\nSea level: 330 km/h\nAt 3,800 m: 434 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 8,400 m\nRange: 1,690 km\n\nArmament:\n4 \u0425 .303 cal machine guns (forward-firing)\n3 \u0425 .303 cal machine gun (defensive)\nUp to 1,800 kg of bombs\n\nThe A-20 began as a Douglas Model 7 in 1936, when the Douglas Aircraft Company attempted to build a new twin-engine ground attack plane. It was not built to US Air Force specifications, but rather as a free design intended to be sold to any interested parties. The first order was placed in February of 1938 by the French, who ordered 100 planes. \n\nThe French requested multiple modifications, and the resulting Douglas Model 7B was very different from the initial prototypes. Only 60 were delivered before Germany invaded France, most of which did not see combat. Some went on to fly for the Vichy regime; some others remained in service with the Free French until the end of the war. The French had placed an additional order for DB-7s fitted with the Wright R-2600-A5B Double Cyclone engines; however none were delivered in time.\n\nGreat Britain took over the contract after France surrendered, and re designated the ex-French planes Boston Mk I and Mk II. \n\nBy now the design was mature enough to warrant some American attention, and the USAAF ordered the DB-7B for their use, now designated A-20 Havoc. \n\nThe main shortcoming of the Boston, as far as the British were concerned, was its short range. The next variant they ordered, Boston Mk III, was to have larger fuel tanks, as well as redesigned instrument panel and improved electrical and hydraulic systems.\n\nLooking to standardize their variants, the US Air Force ordered what was essentially the Boston Mk III as the A-20C. Many of the aircraft initially intended for British and Soviet use were kept by the US after Pearl Harbor. It was the most numerous early-war variant of the A-20, before the definitive A-20G was introduced in 1943.\n\nMain Variants:\nDouglas Model 7A - initial prototype, powered by 450 hp Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior engines.\nDouglas Model 7B - redesigned Model 7A, now powered by 1,100 hp Pratt & Whitney R-1830 S3C3-G. 270 ordered by the French.\nDB-7 B-3 - redesigned to French specifications. 1,000 hp Pratt & Whitney R-1830-SC3-G engines, metric instruments, French guns.\nBoston Mk I - French DB-7B with 1,000 hp Pratt & Whitney R-1830-SC3-G engines in British service.\nBoston Mk II - French DB-7B with 1,100 hp Pratt & Whitney R-1830-S3C4-G engines in British service.\nHavoc Mk I - Boston Mk I and II converted for night-time fighting, either as bombers or heavy fighters.\nDB-7A - built to French specifications with 1,600 hp Wright R-2600-A5B Double Cyclone engines.\nHavoc Mk II - DB-7A in British Service, used as night-fighters.\nDB-7B - redesigned DB-7A with improved range, armament, and armor.\nBoston Mk III - DB-7B in British service.\nDB-7C - ordered by Netherlands, but due to Japanese invasion the order was canceled, and these were sent to USSR.\nA-20 - initial USSAF version, similar to the DB-7B but with turbo supercharged Wright R-2600-7 engines.\nA-20A - first serial variant in service with the USAAF.\nA-20B - DB-7A modified for the USAAF.\nA-20C - Boston Mk III in USAAF service.\n\nAdvantages:\nLong range\nPowerful Armament by early-war standards\n\nDisadvantages:\nPoor defensive gun coverage\n\n\n\n

A-20G             \n    Douglas A-20G Havoc\n\nType: Ground Attack\n\nWeight:\nGross: 10,941 kg (24,127 lbs)\n\nLength: 14.6 m (48 ft)\nWingspan: 18.6 m (61 ft)\n\nEngine: 2 x Wright R-2600-23\nPower: 1,600 HP\n\nTop speed:\nAt 3780 m (12,400 ft): 510 km/h (317 mph)\n\nService Ceiling: 7,864 m (25,800 ft)\nRange: 1,650 km (1,025 miles)\n\nArmament:\n6 x .50-cal Browning M2 machine guns (nose)\n3 x .50-cal Browning M2 machine guns (defensive)\n4,000 lbs of bombs\n\nDouglas Aircraft Company started on the A-20 project in 1936 as a replacement for the light single-engine attack planes of the day. This plane wasn't a response to any Air Force requirements, but rather Douglas own initiative which they built and tested and then offered to foreign buyers.\nFrance was the first customer, purchasing 100 units with a long list of specific modifications. Their planes were designated DB-7 and first flew in August of 1939. France only got 60 of them before they were attacked by Germany, and only 12 DB-7s saw action. Remaining French DB-7 were sent to England, which also ordered hundreds of additional DB-7s.\nIn May of 1939 USAAC also ordered A-20s for their own use. They requested various modifications including more powerful defensive armament. First operational aircraft were designated A-20A. Additional versions continued to be designed and produced throughout the war. Production totaled 7,385 A-20s of all variants, and they served with United States, British, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, Soviet, Dutch and Brazilian air forces.\n\n\n\nAdvantages:\nPacks a powerful punch. Good armor protection and range.\n\nDisadvantages:\nHeavy, not very maneuverable.\n\n\n

The story of the new modification of the famous Fort began with the heavy escort fighter prototype designated YB-40, which was basically the basic B-17 with more flexible machine guns. YB-40 made a rather poor fighter, but the Bendix nose turret proved successful and was recommended for installation on B-17s. The nose turret is the main new feature on the B-17G. First example took to the skies in July of 1043, and serial production aircraft entered service in the fall of the same year.\nAs the other variants, the B-17G was produced by three different countries: Boeing in Seattle (-BO), Douglas in Long Beach (-DL) and Lockheed-Vega in Burbank. Interestingly enough Douglas made no distinction between the F and G variants, and first examples of the new modification were designated B-17F-70-DL, -75-DL and -80-DL (altogether 76 B-17Gs were produced with such designation). \nDuring the production run the B-17G received several further modifications. The most notable addition was the new tail gunner position, known as Cheyenne which was fitted on the G-80-BO, G-45-DL \u0438 G-35-VE series and up. As opposed to the previous design where the gunner had to spend most of the mission on his knees, the new position provided a bit more comfort. Starting in January of 1944 B-17s were no longer painted with camouflage colors (G-35-BO, G-20-VE and G-35-DL series and up). In late 1944 the radio room machine gun was deleted.\nB-17G became the most mass produced variant, with 8,680 built. Boeing built 4,035, Douglas 2,395 and Lockheed 2,250 Flying Fortresses.\n\nMain Variants:\nB-17G-10-BO  initial variant with the Bendix nose turret\nB-17G-90-BO  variant with the Cheyenne tail gunner position\nB-17G-100-BO  variant with the electric control column booster, which made controlling the plane easier. \n\nAdvantages:\nHigh bomb load\nPowerful defensive armament\nLong range\nHigh survivability\n\nDisadvantages:\nSomewhat low airspeed\nUncomfortable tail gunner position on earlier variants.\n\n

The Consolidated team however proposed to build a whole new bomber, promising it would be better than the B-17. Army Corps was interested in competition, so the idea was accepted. On March of the same year, Consolidated received an order for first prototype, designated XB-24. Nine months later, first of the future B-24s flew with great success. \n\nFirst versions, supplied to British and USAAF were not ready for combat, instead they were used for transport and maritime observation. It was B-24D, equipped with turbochargers, increased fuel capacity, and better armament which paved its path to glory. By this time, the Liberator was by far the most complicated and most expensive allied aircraft. It could carry greater bomb load and was faster than B-17, but was less stable in flight and not even near the battle damage resistance. \nThe US Navy equivalent - the PB4Y - was used extensively in the Pacific as a maritime patrol bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. \nDuring their WWII service, Liberators dropped more than 630,000 tons of bombs.\n\n\nManufacturer:\nConsolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation, United States of America\n\nMain Modifications:\nB-24D  First mass production version.

Boeing won the competition and was awarded an order for two prototypes in August 1940. \nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor, heavy bomber fleet was given a priority, so production of future B-29 took much faster pace. The demand for the aircraft was great and even with thorough testing not over yet, all freshly assembled Superfortresses were flown to Kansas and tested. Testing and assembling were taking place at the same time.\nIn late 1943 it became clear that there were enough heavy bombers in European theatre, so B-29 fleet was allocated to the Pacific. When the Marianas were conquered by US forces, the Japan itself came in range of Superfortress. At the time, housing in Japan was more or less made of wood, hence the incendiary explosives was deemed to make more damage. The results were horrible  on the night March 9-10, 279 B-29s flew over Tokyo, releasing their incendiary bombs, which caused huge fires, killing more than 80,000 inhabitants. Soon more Japanese cities, namely Nagoya, Osaka and Kobe saw similar destruction.\nOn August 6 1945, B-29 Enola Gay dropped a nuclear bomb named Little boy on Hiroshima, and three days later another Superfortress dropped another nuke - Fat Man - on Nagasaki. B-29 opened the atomic age.\n\nManufacturer:\nBoeing Aircraft Company, United States of America.\n\n\nMain Modifications:\nB-29  Main mass production version. 2,513 built.\nB-29A  New engines - 4 \u00D7 Wright R-3350-57/59 Duplex Cyclone with 2 turbochargers.

They served both in the European and Pacific theaters of the war. As the Beaufighter was a follow-up design on the Bristol Beaufort bomber, and Australia were already producing license-built Beauforts, the Australian Department of Aircraft Production also decided to produce Beaufighters.\nProduction of their license-built Beaufighter, designated DAP Beaufighter Mk 21, began in 1944. Altogether 581 Australian Beaufighters, 365 of them Mk 21s, were produced between 1944 and 1946.\n\nAdvantages:\nVery adaptable.

The first flight of the XF2A-1 prototype was on December 2nd 1937. The prototype was equipped with a 950HP Wright R1820-22 Cyclone engine and a Hamilton Standard variable pitch propeller. The US Navy accepted the XF2A-1 and ordered serial production of the F2A-1 for its carriers.\n\nThe Brewster Model 239 (F2A-1) was an all-metal single-seat shipboard fighter monoplane with a retractable undercarriage. 54 examples of the model were ordered from the Brewster Aeronautical Corporation by the US Navy, but only 11 F2A-1s entered service starting from June 1939, while the remaining 43 were released for export to Finland.\n\nF2A-1 was already an obsolete aircraft by US standards when it entered service, so an updated version with a 1,200 HP R-1820-G40 engine and a Curtiss Electric prop was produced, designated F2A-2. Export variant of the F2A-2 with a Hamilton Standard prop, reflector gunsight, and removed carrier equipment were designated B-339 and served with the British (B-339E) and Netherlands (B-339D) air forces.\n\nBy May of 1941 F2As were replaced with F4F Wildcats in US carrier service, and were transferred to land-based squadrons. Their most significant engagement in the Pacific happened during the battle of Midway, when the Japanese shot down 13 Buffaloes and destroyed 6 more on the ground for the loss of 3 of their bombers and 2 fighters. They were also used in the defence of Singapore, again with disastrous loss / victory ratio.\n\n\n\nF2A versions:\nF2A-1: first production version \nF2A-2: upgraded engine, released October 1940 \nF2A-3: improved airframe, upgraded electronics \nB-239: export version of F2A-1 \nB-339: export version of F2A-2 \n\n\nAdvantages:\nGood maneuverability and handling characteristics compared to other Allied planes. Spacious and well-organized cockpit. Good visibility, especially backwards. \n\n\nDisadvantages:\nObsolete compared to contemporary Axis planes. Inadequate speed and armament compared to late war planes.\n\n\n\n

Since the design Brewster was working on, failed to convince Navy officials, they allowed Grumman to make a single prototype of their XF4F-1 biplane fighter. But it failed to impress too, so Grumman decided to make a monoplane XF4F-2. Two years later, Grummans fighter, now equipped with new Twin Wasp engine, slightly outperformed its competitor in the fly-off evaluation and won the contract. \nFirst F4F-3, as it was now called, flew on August 20, 1940. At the outbreak of war in the Pacific, it was the Wildcat who protected the US Naval fleet from Japanese fighters. They were no match for agile A6M Zero, however it was rugged and structurally reliable, it had self-sealing fuel tanks, and was a stable gun platform. .50-caliber Browning machine guns were effective against Zero, which had much less protection and no self-sealing tanks. \nIn addition to that, Wildcat pilots developed efficient tactics to fight against the opponents, equipped with more agile machines. Coupled with Japans inability to train qualified replacements to lost aircrews this made the F4F more and more effective as the war progressed.\nThat became increasingly clear during Guadalcanal campaign. Wildcats inflicted heavy losses to Japanese air fleet during battles for Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz.\n\nIn mid 1942 it became clear Grumman had to concentrate on the production of its new fighter  F6F Hellcat. So they contracted Eastern Division of General Motors Company to build Wildcats under the designation FM-1and FM-2. \n\nManufacturer:\nGrumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation and General Motors Company , United States of America\n\nMain Modifications:\nF4F-3A  95 Wildcats with different engine (P&W R-1830-90). 95 built.\nF4F-4  folding wings introduced, 2 machine guns added. 1168 built.\nFM-1  F4F-4 built by General Motors, armed with 4x .50 cal MG, 430 rounds each. 1060 built.\nFM-2  Definitive version.

Since the design Brewster was working on, failed to convince Navy officials, they allowed Grumman to make a single prototype of their XF4F-1 biplane fighter. But it failed to impress too, so Grumman decided to make a monoplane XF4F-2. Two years later, Grummans fighter, now equipped with new Twin Wasp engine, slightly outperformed its competitor in the fly-off evaluation and won the contract. \nFirst F4F-3, as it was now called, flew on August 20, 1940. At the outbreak of war in the Pacific, it was the Wildcat who protected the US Naval fleet from Japanese fighters. They were no match for agile A6M Zero, however it was rugged and structurally reliable, it had self-sealing fuel tanks, and was a stable gun platform. .50-caliber Browning machine guns were effective against Zero, which had much less protection and no self-sealing tanks. \nIn addition to that, Wildcat pilots developed efficient tactics to fight against the opponents, equipped with more agile machines. Coupled with Japans inability to train qualified replacements to lost aircrews this made the F4F more and more effective as the war progressed.\nThat became increasingly clear during Guadalcanal campaign. Wildcats inflicted heavy losses to Japanese air fleet during battles for Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz.\n\nIn mid 1942 it became clear Grumman had to concentrate on the production of its new fighter  F6F Hellcat. So they contracted Eastern Division of General Motors Company to build Wildcats under the designation FM-1and FM-2. \n\nManufacturer:\nGrumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation and General Motors Company , United States of America\n\nMain Modifications:\nF4F-3A  95 Wildcats with different engine (P&W R-1830-90). 95 built.\nF4F-4  folding wings introduced, 2 machine guns added. 1168 built.\nFM-1  F4F-4 built by General Motors, armed with 4x .50 cal MG, 430 rounds each. 1060 built.\nFM-2  Definitive version.

FM-2 was developed with capability for air-to-ground strikes in mind, so hard points under wings were strengthened to carry either heavier bombs or HVAR rockets. The modifications led to notable increase of performance, namely higher speed, greater maneuverability and longer range. The FM-2 had a distinctive, taller vertical tail. FM-2 were exclusively operated from escort carriers and were often teamed with TBM Avengers to fight the submarines and to provide air cover plus close air support for ground troops. \n\n\nManufacturer:\nEastern Division of General Motors Company , United States of America\n\nMain Modifications:\nFM-1  F4F-4 built by General Motors, armed with 4x .50 cal MG, 430 rounds each. 1060 built.\nFM-2  Definitive version.

With cockpit situated at the far rear of the fuselage and seagull-like bent wings it was an interesting looking design, to say the least. \nVought-Sikorsky Division of the United Aircraft Corporation, at the time still as one corporation, started work on carrier based fighter, which would be equipped with the most powerful engine at the time. From the start, Pratt-Whitney R-1830 Wasp air-cooled radial engine was chosen due to its reliability and proven design. However later the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp, then still in experimental phase, was chosen for the XF4U-1 prototype. In order to get as much as possible out of this huge and powerful engine, a huge three-blade Hamilton Standard Hydromatic prop with diameter of 4.06 meters was selected. This caused new problems  there was not enough clearance from prop tips to the ground. A solution was found which made Corsairs looks so distinctive  wings were bent in typical gull-shape.\nThe prototype first flew in May 1940 and from first tests onward it was clear, that Corsair was a very powerful aircraft. In October of the same year, it flew faster than 650 km/h in level flight, the first US aircraft to do so. However the Corsair had its share of problems. Pilots complained about slow aileron response, poor low speed performance, poor forward vision, a nasty tendency to drop one wing just before flaring as result of torque stall, tendency to bounce upon landing and poor rudder effectiveness on ground. \nFirst operational version F4U-1 was handed over in July 1942, just a day after Hellcat entered service, but Navy found Corsair to be too tricky for operation from aircraft carriers, so first batches were sent to US Marine Corps. First unit to fly F4U-1 was VMF-122, declared operational in December 1942 and shipped to Guadalcanal, where its pilots flew first combat mission in February 1943.

F-86A5            \n    F-86A-5NA Sabre Jet (MOD), 1950 Model\n\nType:  Fighter\n\nWeight:  6,255 kg\n\nLength:  11.44 m  \nWingspan:  11.31 m  \n\nEngine:  General Electric J-47-GE-13\nPower:  \nTake off: 5,200Lbs Thrust\n\nSpeed at Military mode:  \nSea level: 1,092 km/h (679 Mph)\nClimb to 6.000m: UNKNOWN\nService ceiling:  14,630 m  (48,000 ft)\nRange:  1,062 Km  \n\nArmament:  6 x 12.7 mm MG53-3 (API/T)\n\nThe North American F-86 Sabre A.K.A Sabre Jet was the western worlds premier fighter aircraft during the early 1950s called upon during the Korean War to combat the infamous MiG-15s. This had an exceptionally long service career starting in 1949 and ending in the mid 1990s. It was the US Air Forces first swept-wing fighter incorporating similar technology developed by the Germans in WWII and new developments such as the all flying horizontal stabilizer that was to be used on all future jet aircraft.\nThe F-86A-5 is the first of these three Sabre aircraft, it incorporates ejection seats, six 0.50 calibre M3 heavy machine guns using Armour Piercing Incendiary Tracer (AP-I-T) rounds with a higher fire rate than the M2 used on aircraft such as the P-51D. This variant used the J47-GE-13 engine generating 5200lbs of thrust propelling this aircraft to a top speed of 679Mph TAS (1,092Km/h TAS), max range (internal fuel) of 660 miles (330 miles Combat Radius) and a climb rate of 7,740ft/min (38m/s). The F-86 incorporated air brakes and hydraulically boosted controls which accentuates the pilots input thus requiring less strength to control the aircraft, because of this, these aircraft feel quite stable at high speed yet nimble with a rate of roll of 180 degrees (2 seconds to complete a roll!).\n\nAdvantages: Ability to reach mach 1.0 in dives and high and low speed maneuverability.\n\nDisadvantages: The climb rate compared to that of the MiG-15Bis was much lower, the affect of 0.50 caliber machine guns in jet combat proved to lack the hitting power required to make a kill compared to that of the MiG-15Bis, Its high altitude behavior causes the controls to stiffen at high speed and its maneuverability drops off considerably compared to the MiG-15Bis. \n\n
F-86F25E          \n    F-86F-25NA Early Sabre Jet (MOD), 1953 Model\n\nType:  Fighter\n\nWeight:  6,795 kg\n\nLength:  11.44 m  \nWingspan:  11.31 m  \n\nEngine:  General Electric J-47-GE-27\nPower:  \nTake off: 5,910Lbs Thrust\n\nSpeed at Military mode:  \nSea level: 1,118 km/h (695 Mph)\nClimb to 6.000m: UNKNOWN\nService ceiling:  14,630 m  (48,000 ft)\nRange:  1,474 Km  \n\nArmament:  6 x 12.7 mm MG53-3 (API/T)\n\nF-86F-25E (E for Early) 1953\nThis is the standard variant of the F-86F-25 not historically called E but given that name as to differentiate the aircraft from the variants that were retrofitted with the new 6-3 wing. The F-86F-25E uses the J47-GE-27 engine generating 5910lbs of thrust allowing top speeds of 695Mph TAS (1,118Km/h TAS) at sea level, improved max range (internal fuel) of 916 miles (458 miles Combat Radius) and a greatly improved climb rate of 9,300ft/min (47m/s). The new flying tail where the horizontal stabilizer rotates as well as separate elevator control for lower speeds, increased climb rate, improved hydraulics and better engine made this aircraft highly maneuverable at high transonic and sonic speeds. These changes improved the high speed turning capabilities but still could not best the MiG-15 at high speeds and high altitudes making this aircraft a superior fighter in lower speed combat. \n\nAdvantages: Ability to reach mach 1.0 in dives. The use of flying tail makes much better high and low speed maneuverability at all heights compared to the F-86A-5NA. Climb rate is higher than F-86A-5NA\n\nDisadvantages: The climb rate compared to that of the MiG-15Bis is lower, the affect of 0.50 caliber machine guns in jet combat proved to lack the hitting power required to make a kill compared to that of the MiG-15Bis.\n\n
F-86F25L          \n    F-86F-25NA Late Sabre Jet (MOD), 1953 Model\n\nType:  Fighter\n\nWeight:  6,795 kg\n\nLength:  11.44 m  \nWingspan:  11.31 m  \n\nEngine:  General Electric J-47-GE-27\nPower:  \nTake off: 5,910Lbs Thrust\n\nSpeed at Military mode:  \nSea level: 1,118 km/h (695 Mph)\nClimb to 6.000m: UNKNOWN\nService ceiling:  14,630 m  (48,000 ft)\nRange:  1,474 Km  \n\nArmament:  6 x 12.7 mm MG53-3 (API/T)\n\nF-86F-25L (L for Late) 1953\nThis variant is similar to that of the F-86F-25E however it uses the new 6-3 wing. The leading edge slats which gave the Sabre its superb low speed handling were found to be a hindrance at high speed and high altitude dogfights causing drag and limiting its potential. The 6-3 replaced the slats and extended the wing by 6 inches at the root and 3 inches at the wing tip. This although reduced it low speed handling and requirement of faster landings, did however increase its high speed turn which marginally out performs the MiG-15Bis, making this the Air Superiority Fighter that it was always intended to be. This can now match and beat the MiG-15Bis at all alts below its service ceiling of 48,000ft. It was not completely superior to the MiG-15 however it could fight on more equal terms; this and the F-86F-25E can reach Mach 1.0 in a shallow dive and reach near supersonic speeds of Mach 1.2 before the aircrafts structure begins to fail.\n\nAdvantages: Ability to reach mach 1.0 in dives. The use of flying tail makes much better high and low speed maneuverability at all heights compared to the F-86A-5NA. The use of the "6-3" wing increases its high speed maneuverability allowing it to out perform the MiG-15Bis at all heights below the MiG-15Bis service ceiling, Climb rate is higher than F-86A-5NA\n\nDisadvantages: The climb rate compared to that of the MiG-15Bis is lower, the affect of 0.50 caliber machine guns in jet combat proved to lack the hitting power required to make a kill compared to that of the MiG-15Bis. Low speed handling is poorer and earlier stall.\n\n
A5M4              \n    A5M4, 1938\n\nType: Carrier-Borne Fighter\n\nAllied Code Name: Claude\n\nWeight:\nEmpty: 1,110 kg\nTake-off: 1,422 kg\n\nLength: 7.65 m\nWingspan: 11 m\nWing area: 17.8 sq m\n\nEngine: 1 \u0425 Nakajima Kotobuki 41\nPower: 785 HP at 3,000 m\n\nTop speed:\nAt 3,000 m: 434 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 9,800 m\nRange: 1,200 km\n\nArmament:\n2 \u0425 7.7mm Type 89 machine guns\nUp to 60 kg of bombs or 1 x 160 l drop tank.\n\nIn the early 1930s the Empire of Japan was working hard to become self-sufficient in its aviation. A slew of specifications was issued, all calling for Japanese-designed warplanes that could be built with no foreign components. When the specification for a new carrier-borne monoplane fighter was issued in 1934, all the air forces in the world still used biplanes on their aircraft carriers. A Mitsubishi prototype, designated Ka-14, exhibited excellent performance in the flight trials in early 1935, the test program progressed well, and by the fall of 1936 the new fighter was ready for production as Navy Type 96 Carrier Fighter Model 1. \n\nThe development of the third production variant, the A5M4 was spurred on by the requirement for longer range, brought on by the Japanese experience in the Nomonhan incident (battle of Khalkin Gol). Sporting larger fuel tanks, the A5M4 was externally identical to its predecessor the A5M2 Otsu save for a few minor changes like the redesigned windscreen. The A5M4 was built in larger numbers than any other variant of the A5M.\n\nBy 1940 the vastly superior A6M Zero fighter entered the scene, and the immediately obsolescent A5Ms were quickly replaced. In 1941-42 most of the A5Ms were in service with rear guard air defense units. However A5Ms aboard the Ruyjo and Zuiho light carriers participated in action at Malaya, Dutch East Indies, and later in the Bay of Bengal. Land-based A5Ms were based at Rabaul, the Marshall Islands and Palau as late as the end of 1942, and at Buin as late as September of 1943.\n\nBy late 1944 all remaining A5Ms were in service at training schools throughout the Japanese Empire. In early 1945 most of the remaining examples were used in kamikaze attacks.  A total of 1,094 A5Ms of all variants were built.\n\nMain Variants:\nKa-14  first prototype; two-blade propeller. Open cockpit.\nA5M1  initial production version with 580 HP Hikari 1 engine; two-blade propeller. Open cockpit.\nA5M1 Otsu  A5M1 with 2 x 20mm Oerlikon FF cannons\nA5M2  610 HP Kotobuki 2 KAI 3A engine; three-blade propeller. Open cockpit.\nA5M2 Otsu  A5M2 with provisions for 2 x 30kg bombs.

As the result by 1943 all the A6Ms advantages were lost, and new American fighters were at least as good or better than the Zero. In the summer of 1943 things became really difficult for the Japanese pilots when the excellent F6F Hellcat entered combat. A6M5 was the attempt to bridge the gap. A6M3 was the basis for this modification; the wing was redesigned and the wingspan was reduced to 11 meters. Wingtips became rounded, and wing surface was strengthened. Finally, the exhaust collector ring was replaced by individual stacks to increase top speed.  \nA6M5 entered serial production in the fall of 1943. Despite the modifications, A6M4 was still inferior to the F6F. While it had better maneuverability it had a significantly lower top speed. In addition to that the plane still had no self-sealing tanks, which made it very easy to bring down.\n\nMain Variants:\nA6M5  initial variant with the NK1C Sakae-21 Engine, 1130 HP \nA6M5a  strengthened wing, more ammo for 20mm cannons, two 13.2 machine gun instead of two 7.7mms\nA6M5b  further modifications of the A6M5a. Self sealing tanks and a better armored seat. \nA6M5c  Land-based variant. Small production run.\n\nAdvantages:\nGood maneuverability\nGood pilot visibility\n\nDisadvantages:\nWeak armor (A6M5  A6M5a)\nNo self-sealing tanks (A6M5  A6M5a)\nLow top speed\n\n

It first flew on April 1st, 1939. As the prototype was unable to reach the required speed, the third prototype was equipped with the 940 HP Nakajima NK1C Sakae-12 engine. This became the basis for the first serial variant, A6M2.  First production fighters were used in China, where they were extremely effective against mostly obsolete Chinese fighters. During this time some changes were made to the planes construction, for example the wings were strengthened. By December 7th 1941 Japan had 328 A6M2s.\n \nMain Variants:\n\u04106M2 NK1C Sakae-12 Engine, 950 HP\nA6M3  NK1C Sakae-21 Engine, 1130 HP\nA6M5 - NK1C Sakae-21 Engine, 1130 HP.

The A6M2-N was a temporary solution ordered in 1940, pending the completion of the Kawanishi Kyofu floatplane.\n\nThe Rufe contract was awarded to Nakajima, who selected to adapt the famous Mitsubishi Zero fighter for this role. Rufes airframe was of the Zero Model 11. Main center float and two wing tip floats were specifically designed for good performance in aerial combat. The vertical stabilizer and the rudder were also enlarged to compliment the added floats.\n\nA total of 327 A6M2s were produced.

C-47 could carry 2,722 kg of cargo, 28 paratroopers, or 14 wounded with three medical personnel.\nC-47s and modifications were heavily used in WWII, as well as the Korean and Vietnam wars. Many C-47s are used even today. USSR used a C-47 variant called Li-2, and in the UK it was known as Dakota.\n\nMain Variants:\nC-47 (Dakota I) (R4D-1) first mass-produced variant equipped with Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92 Twin Wasp engines. 965 built.\nC-47A (Dakota III)  most mass-produced version of the C-47 with a 24-volt electric system; 5,253 built.\n\u0421-47B (Dakota IV)  improved heating and new Pratt & Whitney R-1830-90\u0421 Twin Wasp engines with two-speed superchargers. 3,232 built. This version was developed for use in the China-Burma-India theater for better high altitude capability. \n\nAdvantages:\nGreat cargo capacity for its class.\n\nDisadvantages:\nNo defensive armament.\n\n

The Plane Type 4 was mainly intended to replace the obsolete Ki-43 fighter. Externally the plane looked like its predecessor somewhat, but had a more powerful Ha-45-21 engine and more powerful armament. \nThe first prototype designated N.8401 first flew in April of 1942. In August of the same year N.8402, a second prototype, also entered the testing. The prototypes different by having more exhaust pipes on the sides of the fuselage, as well as exposed MG barrels above the engine. The prototypes were followed by a production run of 83 aircraft intended for combat testing at the front. During those tests several modifications were made, most notably changes to the tail and rudder design. Full-scale production began in April of 1944 at the Nakajima Hikoki K.K. factories in cities of Ota and Utsonomiya. \nThe new airplane was in many aspects superior to most contemporary Allied planes. Due to the powerful engine the Ki-84 had a better climb rate than the P-51D and P-47D, and it was considerably more maneuverable. Pilot protection was also great, with 65 mm armored glass and 13mm armored seat. The armament was quite powerful, with twin 12.7 synchronized machine guns and two 20mm wing cannons.\nKi-84-1b became a further development of the series. The two 12.7 machine guns were replaced with two synchronized 20mm cannons. This greatly increased the Ki-84s killing power, making it especially stand out among the generally weak armament on most Japanese fighters.\nKi-84-1a and 1b were certainly formidable opponents, especially so in the hands of an experienced pilot. Altogether 3,382 Ki-84s of all variants were produced. \n\nMain Variants:\nKi-84-1a Ha-45-21 engine with 1,970 HP. Twin 12.7 synchronized machine guns and two 20mm wing cannons.\nKi-84-1b 20-mm synchronized cannons instead of the 12.7mm MGs\nKi-84-1b KAI Ki-84-1b with 1,970 HP a Ha-45-21 engine, or a 2,000 HP Ha-45-23.  Some airframe modifications, including wooden rear fuselage.\nKi-84-1\u0441  Two 20-mm and two 30-mm cannons, designed to attack US heavy bombers\nKi-84-1\u0441 KAI Ki-84-1\u0441 equipped with a 1,970 HP Ha-45-21 engine or a 2,000 HP Ha-45-23 engine.

Ki-84-Ic          \n    Ki-84-1c Hayate/Frank 1944\n\nType: Interceptor/Fighter Bomber\n\nWeight:\nTake-off: 3,750 kg\nMaximum: 4,330 kg\n\nLength: 9.85 m\nWingspan: 11.30 m\nWing Area: 21.02 sq.m\n\nEngine: 1 x Ha-45-21\nPower:\nTake-off: 1,970 HP\n\nTop Speed:\nSea Level: 584 km/h\nAt 6,120 m: 687 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 11,582 m\nRange: 2,920 \u043Am\n\nArmament:\n2 x 20-mm Ho 5 cannon\n2 \u0425 30-mm Ho-105 cannon\n2 \u0425 250 kg bombs\n\nThis modification of the Ki-84 was designed specifically to counter the American B-29 Superfortress. Earlier Ki-84-1c versions differed from the Ki-84 only in armament. The 1C had the strongest armament of any Japanese plane. Fortress Killer had two 20mm and two 30mm cannons, which could easily turn any bomber into a cloud of debris.\nBy early 1945 Nakajima began producing modified versions of the Ki-84, which due to lack of aluminum used some wooden parts. Most planes of this sub variant were equipped with the 1,970 HP Ha-45-21 engines; other examples used a 2,000 HP Ha-45-23 fuel injection. Unfortunately for the Japanese the Ki-84-1c appeared too late in the war.  It did little to stop the American aerial armadas, also due to the fact that few Ki-84-1cs were built.  \n\nMain Variants:\nKi-84-1\u0441  Main modification with a 1,970 HP Ha-45-21 engine\nKi-84-1\u0441 KAI Ki-84-1\u0441 equipped with a 1,970 HP Ha-45-21 engine or a 2,000 HP Ha-45-23 engine. Some airframe modifications, including wooden rear fuselage.\n\nAdvantages:\nStrong armament for a Japanese fighter\nExcellent climb rate and maneuverability\n\nDisadvantages:\nPoor control on taxiing. \nLack of fire extinguisher or emergency canopy jettison\nUse of wood in later models had a negative impact on survivability\n\n

Beginning in mid-1938, a total of five prototypes in both twin-float and single-float configurations were built, with the twin-float configuration being chosen for production in early 1939 after extensive testing and sea trials. The first production models became a standard feature aboard the cruisers and battleships of the Kriegsmarine. Following the opening of hostilities, early combat experiences highlighted the lack of armament needed to deal with marauding enemy fighters. This brought about the Ar-196A-2 version, introduced in late 1939 and armed with two wing-mounted 20mm MG-FF cannons and a fuselage-mounted 7.92mm MG 17 machine gun, in addition to the standard flexible defensive MG 15. This weapons configuration had been tested on the Ar-196V-4 prototype. Communications upgrades, a propeller spinner, and strengthening of the aircraft's structure for catapult launches were introduced on the interim Ar-196A-4. The further addition of a variable-pitch propeller resulted in the A-3 version, which was introduced in mid-1941 and became the most common variant in service. The final production model was the Ar-196A-5, structurally identical to the A-3, but with a twin 7.92mm MG 81Z for the observer and a slightly more powerful BMW 132W engine. The increased defensive gun armament was also retrofitted to some A-3 models. Over 500 examples of all types were produced.\n\nIn service, the Ar-196 was destined to become the most successful German aircraft of its type, and it saw action in every theater of the war. Half a dozen Luftwaffe maritime squadrons eventually used it. Foreign operators included Bulgaria, whose Black Sea maritime squadron employed twelve former SAGr.125 aircraft, and possibly Romania, although the fate of its delivered aircraft is unclear. Sweden, Norway, and Finland were known to have used, confiscated, captured, or borrowed examples. In addition to standard land- and sea-borne squadron service, the Ar-196 served in several remarkable roles. Two aircraft with Japanese markings were assigned on special detachment to screen the harbor of the U-Boat base at Penang, Malaysia. Many unmarked examples flew in an offensive role from Axis commerce raider ships in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Although the most well-known engagement involving Ar-196s was the capture of the submarine HMS "Seal" on May 5 1940, the small Arado seaplane served well throughout the war, fulfilling a variety of roles including coastal reconnaissance, anti-submarine reconnaissance, ship escort, anti-ship attack, courier duty, sea rescue, and even anti-partisan warfare. The aircraft's versatility and widespread usage rank it as one of the Luftwaffe's most outstanding maritime aircraft.\n\nManufacturers:\nArado Flugzeugwerke GmbH at Warnem\u00FCnde, Germany\nSNCASO at St. Nazaire, France (licenced production)\n\n\nMain Modifications:\nAr-196A-3/R1 - FuG 10 (low-frequency parts only), FuG 16, Peil G4\nAr-196A-3/R2 - FuG 10 (full set) with T2G Morse key, FuG 16, FuG 25, Peil G4\nAr-196A-3/U1 - Ice skis fitted to the float keels\n\nAdvantages:\nRobust.

Ar-234B-2         \n    Ar-234B, 1944\n\nType: Jet Reconnaissance / Bomber\n\nWeight:\n Empty: 5,200 kg\n Take-off: 8,417 kg\n Maximum: 9,858 kg\n\nLength: 12.6 m\nWingspan: 14.1 m\nWing area: 25.5 sq m\n\nEngine: 2 x Junkers Jumo-004B\nPower: 900 kg/s\n\nTop speed: 740 km/h\nService Ceiling: 10,000 m\n\nRange: \n Recon variant, high altitude: 1,100 km\n Bomber, high altitude: 720 km\n Bomber, low altitude: 190 km\n\nArmament:\n 2 x 20mm MG-151 cannon (defensive)\n Up to 1,700 kg of bombs\n\nJet development in Germany progressed well by the time they attacked the Soviet Union, with several RLM requirements for jet-powered fighters and bombers offered in 1941. One of these requirements called for a jet reconnaissance plane with the range of 2,150 km. The only company to answer the requirement was Arado, with the E370 project they had in the works since 1940 - a two-engine design utilizing the Junkers Jumo 004 engines. In order to maximize speed, various weight reduction measures had been taken, including the deletion of conventional landing gear.\n\nWhile the airframe prototype of the new project was ready by late 1941, the Junkers Jumo engines were not ready until early 1943, and the first examples offered were unreliable. Arado received first airworthy examples in late spring. The first test flight was made in July of 1943. On November 2nd, 1943, the V-2 prototype crashed and burned after the left engine caught fire. The test pilot was killed while trying to land the damaged plane. \n\nMultiple additional prototypes were built, utilizing different engine mounts: some used BMW-003 engines, and a few of the prototypes were powered by four, not two jets. As early as July of 1943 the prototype began to be considered as a potential schnellbomber (fast bomber), and by March of 1944 the 9th prototype with tricycle landing gear, and V10 with bomb pylons, became the basis for a bomber version designated Ar-234B-2. The external pylons were necessary as the original airframe left no room for the bomb bay; and as the additional drag of the external stores greatly reduced the top speed, provisions were made for a 20mm tail stinger, intended to be remotely-controlled by the pilot through a periscope sight.\n\nDespite the dreadful situation at the front, instead of entering wide-scale production the virtually complete Ar-234 remained in testing for many more months, used as a test-bed for engine tests, and going through various minute changes. Additional sub-variants were created and tested, such as the B-2b and the B-2r, a bomber / recce version, and a longer-range bomber leader variant correspondingly. Finally, on August 2nd of 1944, the first operational mission was flown, a high-altitude recon over an Allied beachhead. By October of that year the first bomber group was ready for operational use of the Blitz.\n\nWhile the operational use of the Ar-234 was sporadic, and many of the production aircraft never took to the air due to the lack of fuel, the development of additional variants continued until the end of the war. A four-engine bomber, a night-fighter, two-seat recon, and many others were drawn up, but never produced.\n\nMain Variants:\nAr 234B-0  Initial version. Pre-production run.\nAr 234B-1 - Recon version.

There are many legends for each prototype that existed. Almost everyone related to aviation has heard stories about it, but very few people know what happened in reality (except for the myths, mystical stories and pure fantasy). History of this planes development, together with people related to it, is full of coincidences and surprises. This aircraft became a legend during its brief life, and still remains an enigma even though many archives have now been opened It was the first battle-ready rocket-powered interceptor in history to go into large-scale serial production. The initial serial production of 40 units was abandoned for many reasons. One of the reasons was that the Germans were not yet able to reach Moscow with their bombers and such an interceptor  requiring complex ground service and unable to follow fast- moving front lines  was no longer needed.\n\nAdvantages: high speed and excellent climb rate, easy controls, strong armor against bomber defensive fire.\n\nDisadvantages: insufficient maneuverability for horizontal fights against maneuverable fighters, limited time of flight due to quick fuel consumption. Low ammo load.\n\nHistory:\nBetween January and March of 1940 the first flights were made by the serial I-153 fighter equipped with a jet engine fixed under the wing and an experimental RP-318-1 rocket plane equipped with a Liquid Propellant Rocket engine (LPR). After that, a meeting took place at TsAGI (Central Aviation and Hydraulics Institute) in Moscow where the main designers of various designing bureaus were informed of a new means of propulsion using jet or rocket engines. As Sergey P. Korolyov suggested in 1938, an LPR with a thrust of 1,000  1,500kg/s turned out to be most effective when used on an interceptor taking off from an advance airfield after enemy aircraft were noticed over the defended area. At that time, radar remained a very vague concept. The small weight and powerful thrust of such an engine would not only provide maximum horizontal speed (about 800 - 850km/h), but also a high rate of climb - almost 10 times greater than the best piston-engine fighters. A fighter with a working LPR, even at an early stage in its flight, could reach an enemy aircraft within about a minute and quickly destroy it with powerful cannon fire. After using up the fuel, the interceptor could leave a battle and land as a lightweight glider. Extremely high fuel consumption, about 4-6 kilograms per a second, remained a huge drawback for the LPR. \n\nMany design bureaus became interested in this new type of engine.  Nikolay N. Polikarpovs design bureau was one of them. By that time, he had already tested this type of engine on his aircraft. Other bureaus included Robert L. Bartinis design bureau, which was interested in flights through the stratosphere and Andrey N. Touplevs bureau, whose varied interests were also widely known. This group of scientists, aircraft designers and pilots who had either already flown (or were experimenting with) rocket aircraft was called the rocket-plane group.\n\nVictor F. Bolhovitinovs design bureau was one of the first to start working in this new direction. The bureau was created at the Gorbunov Plant # 293 and was initiated by the Zhukovskiy Air Force Academy. The bureau was specifically responsible for dealing with totally new types of aircraft. The first aircraft of this kind was a heavy DB-A bomber. The latter was not entirely successful, since the famous pilot Sigizmound A. Levanevskiy and all his crew were lost during a flight over the North Pole on the polar version of the bomber. Luckily, this misfortune  which caused the authorities to draw far-reaching conclusions  did not discourage Victor Bolhovitinov. His talented aircraft designers kept developing new prototypes. This fantastic team did not work directly under NKVD supervision and included, at different times, Alexander Y. Bereznyak, Alexey M. Isaev, Vasiliy P. Mishin, Konstantin D. Bushuev, Nikolay A. Pilyugin, Arkhip M. Lyulka, Michael V. Melnikov, Boris E. Tchertok, Arvid V. Pallo, Boris V. Raushenbah and other experienced engineers, aircraft designers and MAI graduates eager to absorb new ideas. These men later went on to become academics and professors, conventional and cruise missiles designers, developers of rocket engines, submarines and spaceships, members of the team that sent the first men into space, designers of missile control systems, authors and pioneer developers of turbojet engines and navigation systems, and so on. Much later, B. E. Tchertok wrote in his book Rockets and People: the historical significance of this productive talent deserves great appreciation from future generations. This appreciation should be no less than that reserved for the production of jet aircraft and rockets. \n\nAfter the TsAGI meeting, where new types of engine were demonstrated, Bolhovitinovs design bureau concentrated its efforts on LPR aircraft. All of the characteristics of the future aircraft were easily apparent from the limitations imposed by the construction of this type of engine: an unusually high capacity and a horizontal speed and climb rate only possible for about 4 minutes of powered flight.  Soon all conditions for initial design were agreed upon, and two designers from the bureau began working on the rocket interceptor prototype. The designers were the academic A. Y. Bereznyak, who dealt with aerodynamics, and engine specialist A. M. Isayev. Their interceptor would be designed for an engine from Leonid Doushkins LPR team at NII-3. This institution is better known as the Rocket Scientific and Research Institute (RNII). All work within Bolhovitinovs design bureau was conducted during overtime, in addition to all other orders. The work was divided into two parallel stages: independent airfoil creation and engine design in cooperation with the RNII. In 1940, the engine designers promised a quick fulfillment of the order.\n\nThe latest and simplest of the projects was approved by the chief designer and was included in the work plan as a secondary priority. In April 1941, the team received separate space to design the aircraft. The project was officially named BI after the designers last names - Bereznyak and Isaev. \n\nThe aircraft they were working on was a single-seat low-wing plane of mostly wooden construction. The rectangular monolith wing consisted of nine longerons held together with brackets coming around the wings upper and lower contour. Shrenko split landing flaps with a deflection angle of up to 50 degrees were installed on the lower edge of the wing, between the fuselage and the small aileron. The planes tail unit was fairly standard, except for three distinct features: an additional fin between empennage, stabilizer and fuselage; an under-fuselage fin with retractable tailwheel; and round tailplane endplate fins. I. F. Frolov suggested these additions after the first prototype went through aerodynamic and flight tests. Ailerons, wheels and flaps were metal, and fabric-covered. \n\nThe fuselage for the BI was a wooden semi-monocoque. 5.5mm armored plate was installed in the front of the cockpit. Two 20mm ShVAK cannons were installed in the planes nose in front of the pilot, under a removable cover with fasteners. Each cannon had only 45 rounds of ammo. Two tanks with pressurized air, and two with kerosene, were installed in the lower part of the nose, under the guns. Multiple tanks with nitric acid and air were located behind the cockpit. \n\nAn LPR D-1-A-1100 was placed in the tail end of plane. Tractor kerosene was used for fuel, and concentrated 96-98% nitric acid as an oxidizer. The acid was transported to the engine by the air pressure from the tanks, at the rate of 4.2kg of acid per 1kg of kerosene. The engine consumed up to 6kg of kerosene and acid per second at maximum  thrust. The take-off mass of the BI was 1,650kg, and the empty weight was an astonishing 805kg.\n \nOn July 22nd 1941, V. F. Bolhovitinov submitted an official application for the creation of the BI rocket interceptor to the National Committee of Aviation Industry (NCAP). From this moment, all the design bureaus other projects were stopped as the country and the front were demanding warplanes as soon as possible. The BI looked the most promising: its comparative simplicity made it possible to organize the quick mass production of interceptors using low-quality materials and available resources. Design on paper took only 12 days and, on July 9th, a detailed letter signed by seven aircraft designers and engineers participating in the project was submitted to the SDC. On August 1st 1941, the designers held a presentation in the Kremlin and the State Defense Committee  (SDC) ordered V. F. Bolhovitinov to build and test a rocket interceptor. The Minister of Aviation, A. I. Shahurin, and his Deputy of Experimental Aircraft, A. S. Yakovlev,  placed a detailed order that allowed a total of 35 days to build a prototype, even though design on paper was not yet complete. The full impact of this on the designers will probably be never known. A state of emergency was declared at the bureau, drawings were made directly on plywood on the floor, woodworkers from the adjoining factory interpreted these drawings and worked as experienced plane builders, understanding instructions from designers without additional explanations and drawings. There was a lack of important devices, components, machinery, tanks for compressed air and fuel, etc. But despite all this, by the 15th of September 1941 the airframe of the first experimental BI-1 was ready for wind tunnel tests at TsAGI. \n\nAt this point it was not a real plane, just a glider. The team was having serious difficulties with the engine. An RDA-1-150 was used as a basis for development. This engine was used for the RP-318-1 rocket plane. The new engine had to be more powerful, allowing for multiple uses and much wider range of thrust control. The new model was created with an almost 1,000% increase of maximum thrust. It was named  the "D-1-\u0410-1100" (Engine 1st Acid with 1,100kg thrust).  This model used a self-displacing fuel supply (nitric acid and kerosene were used to pull the fuel out). \n\nImmediately following completion of wind tunnel research, test flights began with the airframe towed behind a Pe-2.  By this time, almost all the test pilots from the rocket group had volunteered for the front and were serving with active air regiments. Air Command and NCAP management began to call them back. Boris N. Koudrin was one of them. He was assigned the bulk of the work on the main project. He and the other pilots tested the main flight characteristics of the BI-1 during 15 low-speed flights. All aerodynamic data was confirmed, especially stability and response to control. Theoretical calculations were also confirmed. The BI-1 could easily get back to base after its engine was switched off from an altitude of 3-5km. The designers made the necessary corrections at the drop of a hat: the rudder was enlarged, endplate fins were installed on the horizontal stabilizer and the nose area was increased. \n\nEngine reliability tests were performed simultaneously at the main factory. But on October 16th 1941, mass evacuation from Moscow began. The Bolhovitinov Design Bureau and the whole engine team were evacuated to the deep rear, to Bilimbai village,  60km west of Sverdlovsk. This  naturally slowed down the main work on the engine. The production line and Design Bureau were placed in an old half-ruined factory. The first thing the team had to do was repair the walls and roof of this building. The roof was so bad that the open sky could be seen from almost any spot in the building. The airframe and the engine were intended to be worked on in parallel, and so NII management sent chief engineer A.V. Pallo to Bilimbai for testing. Most of Dushkins group, who stayed in Sverdlovsk, somewhat lost interest in the BI-1 because they had started their own interceptor project, code-named 302. The project was more promising because this type of rocket plane was designed to use both an LPR and a more economical and faster pulse-jet engine. In addition, the first radars were appearing on the front, allowing fighters outside direct visual range to be directed for interception. Unfortunately, neither radars nor the 302 project were widely adopted by the Soviet Union. They were only used in a few isolated instances during World War II. \n\nAt that time, B. N. Koudrin became ill. His replacement was test pilot Grigoriy Y. Bahchivanji, who  from an early age  had been fond of various technical devices, particularly engines. Bahchivanji first came to aviation as an aviation technician. He then graduated from Orenburg Military Flight School in 1934, and, after a short period of military service, he demonstrated excellent piloting skills. He went on to become a test pilot, dealing with new aircraft and various aviation devices including engines. Like most other test pilots, he managed to get to the front as part of the 402nd Special Fighter Regiment. He flew an MIG-3 fighter, the prototype of which he himself had tested on the eve of the war. In the period between July 1st and August 10th 1941, he flew about 70 sorties and scored 7 personal and 10 group victories. His excellent pilot skills during the battle of Moscow resulted in his being appointed to this very important job. \n\nExtremely low temperatures and lack of almost all essentials slowed down fine-tuning of the engine, but by the end of 1942 a test bed for the engine was complete. On the 20th of February, the first serious accident happened. During routine start-up the engine blew up about 3 to 4 seconds after being switched on. The nozzle was blasted several dozens meters away and the front part of the engine hit the back of the pilots seat, cutting off the fastening bolts. Arvid Pallo, who was standing beside the plane, got splashed with nitric acid, and he was scarred for life by these burns. Grigoriy Bahchivanji was a bit luckier - his forehead was cut open on one of the instruments. Although the project was nearly stopped several times, the test bed was reconstructed and a new engine was made. Testing continued after Arvid Pallo and Grigoriy Bahchivanji came back from hospital. Fortunately, an accident of this kind never occurred again, although several people got slightly burned by steam and nitric acid. The team members did not have protective gloves on, even while handling the highly toxic acid. \n\nBy April of 1942, the D-1-A-1100 was finally in working condition. It was immediately installed in the airframe. Then, on April 25th, the plane was sent to the Koltsovo airfield. All future tests would be performed there. On April 27th, the first engine test took place, and  from April 30th on  G. A. Bahchivanji and A.V. Pallo began starting the engine from the planes cockpit. The BI-1s first flight was scheduled for 12.00 pm on May 15th, 1942. \n\nThe morning of that day was cloudy and gloomy. The test pilot came to the airfield earlier than the members of the test committee.  All those who were preparing the plane were nervous, but G. Bahchivanji was in a good mood and was sure that things would go smoothly. At about 5.00 pm, the NII VVS Chief,  P. I. Fyodorov, ordered G. Bahchivanji to carry out weather reconnaissance in a Po-2. As P. Fyodorov revealed later, this order was mainly to warm up and ease the stress on the pilot. After this flight, everybody became more confident that the main flight of that day would succeed. By 7.00 pm, the weather improved, the winds calmed down and the clouds disappeared. The plane was loaded with a minimum stock of fuel, just for take-off and landing: 240kg of nitric acid and 60kg of kerosene. Grigoriy, dressed in a dark-blue flying suit, examined the plane and said:  \n\n- Well, well fly then!\n\nEverybody left the site except for the pilot and the leading engineer. A. Pallo and G. Bahchivanji checked the plane one more time and the pilot announced that he was ready to fly. He increased pressure in the fuel tanks, drained extra liquids and engaged the ignition. The lead engineer controlled the whole procedure and waved his hand, giving his OK to increase power. He accompanied this gesture with a command completely new to the history of aviation:\n\n-\tClear the tail!\n\nAnd he himself barely had time to run away from the wing. The LPR began its low rumbling sound, and the plane rushed down the runway. Take-off was fine but very quick, just 10 seconds after the start. Having reached the set altitude, G. Bahchivanji turned the plane so that the people on the ground could see it. But after 30 seconds of flight, the plane could only be recognized by the  roar of the engine and the fire behind the tail. For V. F. Bolkhovitinov, the time seemed to be passing very slowly, and the flight that lasted 3 minutes 09 seconds in total seemed to take an eternity. At last the plane appeared on the landing area. The landing was a bit rough: one gear strut broke off and the wheel rolled to the side. But in general the flight was successful. \n\nThe Head of the State Committee, V. S. Pyshnov, later noted that this flight opened a new era: the Rocket Age. The BI-1 was the fist jet fighter to perform a take-off, landing and maneuvers, and to pass State tests. It was the first rocket-powered interceptor of a proper class and armament. At that time, abroad, only experimental LPR planes without armament were making flights.  The fact that the pilot only partially fulfilled his task can be explained easily. As this was an absolutely new kind of plane with unusual characteristics, the pilot had to think more quickly and make all movements much faster. The flight was very short in duration and the acceleration was much greater. It is worth noting that, during the 66 seconds the engine was running, the plane reached an altitude of 840 meters with a maximum speed of 400km/hour and a maximum climb of 23m/second. The significant drawback, besides the highly explosive mixture with acid exhaust gases right behind the pilot, was that the only way to reduce the speed of the plane during the flight with the engine switched on was to begin climbing. \n\nThe test pilot stated in his report:\nIn comparison with conventional types of planes, the BI-1 is very pleasant to fly. There is no propeller in front of the pilot; the sound of the engine and exhaust don't reach the cockpit; the pilot can easily observe the front semisphere and can see the back semisphere much better than if he piloted an ordinary plane; the location of the instruments and controls is very good and they are easily accessible; the cockpit is not cluttered; the plane is much easier to control than other fighters. \n\nNII-3 management withdrew A.V. Pallo to Nizhniy Tagil, and then moved him back to Moscow to test the 302 project. He did not work with the BI project any longer. F. Bolhovotinovs design team undertook all further work, tests and improvement of the plane and engine. One of the first unpleasant surprises was that the first prototype suffered significant damage from the nitric acid exhaust gases. Second and the third experimental planes were built for further tests. They differed from the first only in being equipped with retractable skis in place of landing gear. At the same time, NCAP management decided to start building a small series of planes for military tests. These planes were called BI-VS (Army Series). This variant differed from the previous ones by having an extra weapon: a bomb cassette under the fuselage containing small 2.5kg bombs. It was believed that an interceptor would drop bombs on a formation of bombers and destroy them with shockwave and fragments. All BI prototypes from the 4th to the 9th were equipped with this set of weapons.  \n\nThe work was moving along, but something was wrong within the team. At a party celebrating his achievements, Grigoriy astonished all the guests by making the following speech: \n\n-\tMy dear friends, thanks a lot for everything - for your hard work, for wishing me good health. But Im certain Ill be killed in this new plane! Im in clear mind and understand what Im saying. Were at the front of the technical battle, and there will be victims. And Im accepting my fate with a full understanding of my duty. \n\nAt one of the meetings where the schedule of future flights was discussed, he asked chief designers to continue their work no matter what happens. Both these statements turned out to be prophetic. \n\nThe second flight of the BI-2 plane (the number followed that of the planes prototype) took place on January 10th 1943 and was carried out by G. Bahchivanji. He made two more flights within a short period of time. Outstanding fighter pilot Konstantin Y. Grouzdev, who was G. Bahchivanjis commander on the front, made one more flight in this plane. Before the plane landed, a left ski tore off, but K. Grouzdev landed on one ski. In his memoirs, A. Pallo wrote down what Konstantin said after his flight in the BI-2: \n\n- Its quick, its scary, and its pushing from behind Like a devil on a broom. \n\nThe highest performance characteristics for the BI were recorded during these flights: a maximum speed of 675km/hour; vertical climb - 82m/second; altitude  4,000m; length of flight - 6 minutes, 22 seconds; maximum powered flight - 84 seconds. G. Bahchivanji made his sixth and seventh flight on the third prototype. The seventh test flight was made on March 27th 1943. The goal was to reach the maximum speed in horizontal flight at 2,000 meters. Take-off was fine. G. Bahchivanji made two turns and then unexpectedly went into a steep dive at about a 50-degree angle. He struck the ground on the edge of the airfield. Witnesses who ran to the spot where he crashed could not find anything. The wooden plane was burned to a cinder, together with everything in it, including the pilot. \n\nThe special committee that investigated the accident made no findings. That year, a big wind tunnel was introduced,  called the T-106 TsAGI. It was used for testing various airframes and their elements at subsonic speeds. The BI model was tested to determine the causes of the crash. According to the results of the tests, it became clear that the BI-3 crashed because of the specifications of the straight wing and tail unit at subsonic speeds, which were not taken into consideration during the design stage. As a consequence, the plane went into a steep dive from which the pilot could not pull out. The future of sub- and supersonic aviation was swept-wing. \n\nBy a weird accident, at the same time the warehouse of the manufacturing plant burned out. There were about 60 BI-VS aircraft inside, including completed planes and others that were still under construction. The death of the test pilot and the destruction of the planes almost ready for field-testing reflected the destiny of the design bureau in this strange way. However, tests were still continuing. Test pilot B.N. Koudrin and others were appointed to do this work and additional pulse-jet engines were installed on BI-6 wingtips. The BI-7 had the wingroot and cowling shape changed. On another prototype a pressurized cockpit was created by pasting over all the seams with rubber strips. But then BI flights in Sverdlovsk were discontinued, and building work on the new series was cancelled in favor of piston engine planes. The design bureau returned to Moscow and built a new and  remarkable Isayev engine called  the RE-1. It became the forefather of all the engines that were subsequently made by the famous Isayev design bureau. \n\nUnfortunately, neither serial production of BI planes, nor even a series of experimental flights, ever became a reality. Occasional test flights were performed in 1944-45, the last ones in March and April of 1945. Those were glider flights, and the engine was last started in January of 1945. There were miraculous escapes from some of the test flights. On one occasion, the air-stream tore off the gear and the rocket-plane started losing height and falling towards the forest, but Grouzdev didn't leave the plane and managed to lead it through the clearing to the airfield and land. Even though the testing was shut down, flights made by courageous test pilots Grigoriy Bahchivanji, Konstantin Grouzdev, Boris Koudrin and others stimulated the development of jet propulsion and aviation as a whole.  \n\nIt is interesting to note that the sun was setting on Victor F. Bolhovitinovs entire team just as it was rising on the development of jet propulsion. NII-3 was reorganized into NII-1 where all scientific and technical work of this kind was concentrated. The group headed by M. K. Tihonravov was working on the 302 project there. After Stalin's prosecution of N. N. Polykarpov was lifted and he was freed from prison, he could go back to his old high-altitude "Malyutka" fighter-interceptor project. R.L. Bartini worked in the GULAG rocket design bureau with more promising fighter-interceptors, the R and R-114 with swept-wings. Even ordinary chief designers installed jet accelerators on their planes, which helped to reach higher speeds on ordinary aircraft - Pe-2I, La-7R, Yak-3RD and Su-7 - planes with combined engines. Turbojet engines followed them. A completely new era started, the road to which was opened by enthusiasts from the rocket-plane group. \n\nDuring this new era, Victor F. Bolhovitinov continued training new pilots and engineers at the Zhukoskiy Air Force (VVS) Engineer Academy. His former students and brothers-in-arms, who became chief and general designers and famous pilots, continued his work. The students who were listening to his lectures and stories would soon be taking new planes into the air, and building even newer ones.\n\nBut the most mysterious and astonishing fact in the history of the creation of the first BI fighter rocket-plane in the world is the last line of this long story.\n\nMany people remember the words of Yuriy Gagarin, the first man to space:\n\n- If Grigoriy Bahchivanji hadnt made his flights, April 12th 1961 wouldn't have happened.  \n\nBut few people know what Boris E. Tchertok said:\n\n- Rocket history gave birth to Bahchivanji and Gagarin. Both of them took off with the help of rocket engines that tore them off the ground. Both of them also died in crashes at 34 years of age, and both on the same day -  March 27th. In both cases, investigation committees were not able to determine the real causes of their deaths.  \n\n\n

TsAGI concluded that the uncontrollable dive was caused by the wing and tail plane configuration, and as such the airframe would need a complete redesign to function at sub-sonic speeds. No such redesign was ordered, but additional work on the BI continued, with the designers approaching the airframe limits by simply setting the never-exceed airspeed at 750 km/h. \n\nOne of the modifications tested in the TsAGI wind tunnel was the BI-6: a standard BI with two ramjet engines in large nacelles attached to wing tips. The purpose of the extra engines was to increase the overall time of powered flight for the BI. The prototype did not go beyond the wind tunnel tests.\n\nAdvantages:\nIncredible climb rate\nSmall size makes for a difficult target\nEasy to control\n\nDisadvantages:\nInsufficient maneuverability for dogfights\nInsufficient flight time\nShort range\n\n\n

Bristol drew up a design known as Type 135 and showed the results to his Lordship. Rothermere placed an order for a Type 135 fitted with the new Mercury power plant later known as Type 142.\n\nWithin a year, the first Blenheim had flown test flights and proved that it was 50mph (80kph) faster than the Gloster bi-plane fighter called the Gladiator. The fighter had just been ordered into production after it won a contest among other bi-plane fighters. Lord Rothermere was proved to be right, and the Air Ministry got interested in the Blenheim. As it turned out, Lord Rothermere was unable to order one for himself because the whole Bristol production output was limited to military aircraft.\n\nThe Bristol Blenheim was a twin-engined three-seat all-metal construction bomber and long-range reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nOn October 6th 1936, Finland bought 18 MK Is from England. A manufacturing license was also acquired from the Bristol Aeroplane Company on April 12th 1938 and 15 MK Is were ordered from the Finnish State Aircraft factory on April 6th 1939. Before the manufacturing got started,  WWII and the Winter War broke out and Finland bought 24 Blenheim MK Is and IVs from England. During the Interim Peace, the manufacturing began and planes were completed between June 14th 1941 and January 9th 1942. 30 more MK Is and 10 more MK IVs were built by spring 1944 .\n\nThe initial production model was very popular until the start of the War, also outside Great Britain. The lack of an improved design in1938 meant that the Blenheim continued to be used by a number of operators, such as the RAF, even though the Air Ministry had recognized the fact that it was already outclassed substantially by mono-wing fighters. \nNumber built: 1,443\n\n\n\nFAF Numbers:\n   BL-104...121 (= 18 planes)\n   BL-134...190 (= 57 planes)\n\nAdvantages:\n     Max. speed decreases only slightly at higher altitudes.

The first prototype had 2 radial Gnome-Rhone K-14 (800HP each) engines. During 17-26 July 1936, this plane achieved 2 world records: it registered flights at an altitude of 11,294m with a payload of 500kg and at 11,402m with a payload of 1,000kg. \nThe next world record achieved by this plane on August 3rd 1936 was a flight with a 500kg payload at an altitude of 12,816m (in reality it reached 13,178m, but this was not registered officially).\nOn August 5th1936, the plane went into serial production under the designation DB-3. \nOn August 21st,  it achieved a new world record with a 1,000kg payload at 12,101m and then, on September 7th, a 2,000kg payload at 11,005m altitude. Only in May 1946 was the Boeing aircraft able to break this record. \n\nThe second prototype, designated as the TzKB-30, had M-85 engines and also held many records. One of the main records of this plane was an uninterrupted flight over a distance of 8,000km (4,971 miles) from Moscow to Canada on April 28th 1939.  At that time, the DB-3 had already been in serial mass-production for two years. In the VVS and the Soviet Naval Aviation Service, it was used as a long-range bomber.  \n\nThe production of the DB-3 ended in 1940. A total of 1,528 DB-3 bombers were produced. \n\n11 of the captured DB-3s were in service with the Finnish Air Force from 1940 till 1945. \n\nMain modifications:\nDB-3M - equipped with M-87B engines\nDB-3T  torpedo bomber\nDB-3PT  sea plane / torpedo bomber\n\nAdvantages:. Good payload and range. Excellent maneuverability for a 2-engine bomber.\n\nDisadvantages: Hard to control the aircraft over a long flight time. No autopilot.\n\n\n
DB-3F             \n    DB-3F / IL-4 M-88B, 1941 model\n\nType: long-range bomber\n\nWeight: \n    Take-off: 5,800 kg\n    Fully loaded: 11,300 kg\n\nLength: 14.8 m \nWingspan: 21.44 m\nWing area: 66.7sq m\n\nEngine: 2x M-88B, radial\nPower:\n    Take-off: 1,100 HP\n    Indicated: 950 HP\n\nTop speed:\n    Sea level: 370 km/h\n    At 5,400 m: 430-445 km/h (with 1,000 kg bombs)\nService ceiling: 9,700 m (typical)\nRange: 3,800-4,000 km (3,500 km with 1,000 kg payload)\n\nArmament:\n    2 x 7.62 mm MG ShKAS\n    1 x 12,7 mm UBT\n    1,000 kg  internal bomb load\n    Up to 2,500 kg with both internal and external bomb loads\n\nWith the lack of aluminum for the mass-production of long-range bombers in 1938, a new version of the DB-3  designated as the DB-3F  was built. In reality, it was almost a new plane with mixed metal wooden construction that was very easy to implement in serial production. The plane got a new nose with better aerodynamic form and a larger nose-glassed cockpit. The nose-mounted machine gun was replaced with the twin ShKAS turret MGs and the top tail 7.62mm MG turret was replaced with a modern 12.7mm UBT turret. The trials were completed in June 1939 and, at the end of that year, the plane went into serial production. The new DB-3F plane was later re-designated as the Ilyishin IL-4. \nIn 1942 the M-87 (or M-88A) engine was replaced with the more modern M-88B with two stage superchargers that increased the speed at altitude and the service ceiling.  With the lack of metal, some of the IL-4s produced in 1942 got wooden spars in the wings, but later  at the end of 1942  they were again replaced by metal.\nThe IL-4 and the DB-3, together with long-range bombers Yer-2 and Pe-8, were used in August 1941 in bombing raids against the German capital and other cities. The IL-4 was widely distributed in VVS bomber regiments and naval aviation on all fronts. One Black Sea, Baltic Sea and North Sea naval aviation IL-4 was used in a torpedo bomber version. This version was capable of taking two types of torpedo for attacks from low (45-36-AH, 940kg) and high (45-36-AV, 940kg) altitudes. To increase flight time, racks for an additional drop tank were installed under the rear part of fuselage.\nOften it was possible to see the IL-4 flying in mixed formations together with the A-20 and B-25 Lend Lease bombers .\n\nMass production of the IL-2 ended in 1944. In total, 5,256 aircraft of several modifications were built. \n\n3 of the captured IL-4s were in service with the Finnish Air Force. \n\nMain modifications:\nIL-4 with M-88A engines\nIL-4 with M-88B engines with new two stages superchargers \nIL-4T  torpedo bomber\n\nAdvantages:. Good payload and range. Excellent maneuverability for a 2-engine bomber.\n\nDisadvantages: Hard to control the aircraft over a long flight time. No autopilot. Version with wooden tail part of fuselage was easy burning target. Not enough armament for the defense.     \n\n\n

During the single, short-lived operation in Belarus in 1943, the G-11 gliders delivered more than 215 tons of ammunition to troops.\n

The Gladiator was based on the F.7/30 specification, which called for a fighter with top speed of at least 400 km/h, and armament of at least four machine guns.\nThe prototype of the new design designated S.S.37 first flew in September of 1934. The plane was powered by the 645 HP Bristol Mercury M.E.30 and armed with two .303 Vickers Mk.III machine guns and two .303 Lewis guns. After the flight testing concluded RAF ordered an improved version of the plane with the 830 HP Bristol Mercury IX engine and four .30 Browning machine guns.. \nSerial production aircraft began entering service in early 1937. Altogether 378 Mk Is were produced, and many of those would not serve with the RAF. 26 Gladiators were sent to Latvia, 14 to Lithuania, 6 to Norway, 22 to Belgium, 36 to China, 9 to Iraq, 4 to Ireland and 18 to Egypt. The biggest number of exports went to Sweden however; 36 were sent to that country, where they were designated J-8.\n\nAdvantages:\nGood maneuverability\nGood early-war armament\nEnclosed cockpit, which is unusual for biplanes of that era.\n\nDisadvantages:\nObsolete biplane design\nLow top speed\n\n\n

It was very maneuverable, had a good rate of climb and had a good reputation with the British pilots. Camm continually improved the Fury design, striving for cleaner aerodynamics and more powerful engine. However, he realized that aviation was moving forward at a very fast pace and working on the old biplane designs was not the way to go. Camm began thinking about a radically new airplane to replace the Fury.\nCamms new project was initially called Fury Monoplane and used the High Speed Fury variant as the base design. Fuselage basically remained the same, except for receiving a fully enclosed cockpit. The monoplane also inherited Furys empennage and fixed landing gear. It received a brand new wing profile and a new Goshawk steam-cooled engine. When a 1:10 model of the new prototype was shown to RAF officials they were not very enthusiastic  they still preferred bi-planes. \nStill, Camm continued working at his own risk. In January of 1934 Camm received the specs for the new Rolls Royce PV 12 engine, later renamed Merlin. It was clearly superior to the unreliable Goshawk. Biplane Furies equipped with the Merlin had 40 to 60 percent improvement in performance at some altitudes. The Monoplane project also received the Merlin engine. By that time so little remained in it from the Fury that it was renamed to Interceptor Monoplane.\nIn the following months the airframe went through many improvements. Fixed landing gear was replaced with a modern retractable undercarriage. Armament was also changed. Four older Vickers machine guns were to be replaced with eight more powerful Browning MGs.  Radiator was enlarged. Tailplane struts were deleted. Canopy frame was strengthened. \nIn June of 1936 Air Ministry, conscious now of Hitlers rise to power, ordered an astonishing 600 aircraft for the initial production run. This was the largest order in Britains peacetime history.  The new plane was named the Hurricane. \nIn April of 1937 Hawker factories received the first example of the new Merlin II engine, which was immediately mounted on a Hurricane. Changing the plane to work with the new engine took almost five months. On October 12 the new plane flew for the first time, and it was followed by a second example in only six days. \nThe plane was continuously improved during that time. Many modifications to the airframe, new variable speed propeller, engine exhausts, and other changes were made during 1938. Hawker also experimented with different variants of armor to increase the planes survivability. By 1939 prototypes were flying with armor plates behind pilot seats and armored glass. By September of 1939 all Hurricanes received the pilot armor plate.\nIt must be noted that the Hurricane was not the modern fighter it seemed at the first sight. While it was of a more modern monoplane construction and had an enclosed canopy and retractable undercarriage, the Hurricane was not an equal to a Spitfire or a Bf-109. Those planes were all-metal monoplanes; the Hurricane was still an old steel-tube, wood and fabric aircraft, with not much technical innovation in airframe design from the older bi-planes. It was essentially somewhere in-between a WWI-style bi-plane and a modern WWII monoplane.\nBy the beginning of World War II 497 out of the ordered 600 Hurricanes were built. 18 squadrons of Hurricanes were battle ready, while three more were in conversion. The British Expeditionary Force in France had four Hurricane squadrons: No's 85, 87, 1 and 79. Why were the Hurricanes sent to France and not Spitfires? First of all Spitfires were held off to defend the homeland, and Hurricanes wide undercarriage was also much more fitting to the rough airstrips in France. \nDuring the Phony War Hurricanes mostly flew reconnaissance and patrol missions. There was no large-scale activity on either side. The first Hurricane victory was scored in late October when No 1 Squadrons PWO Mould intercepted three Do-17s and shot down one of them. The Germans were so surprised they did not even take evasive action or open fire. The pilots of 73rd Squadron shot down another Dornier on November 2nd. During that time Hurricanes even entered German territory. Lieutenant Plinston shot down a He-111 over Saarbruecken on November 23rd. \nWhen Germany invaded Netherlands and Belgium on May 10, 1940 many Hurricanes were destroyed on the ground. The Hurricanes saw a lot of action during the first week of the Battle of France.  They claimed close to 70 German planes shot down for the loss of 22 Hurricanes. Many more planes were lost on the ground, or abandoned during the retreat. By May 17 only three squadrons remained operational. The squadrons were pulled back to England on May 21st and flew some missions from there. Altogether, 261 Hurricanes were lost in France, more than two thirds of them damaged in accidents or abandoned and burnt on the airfields. During the Dunkirk operation 219 Hurricanes were delivered back to England. Worst of all, 200 pilots were lost during the Battle of France and their loss could not be easily replenished.\nThe main reason behind Hurricane losses was its clear inferiority to the German Bf-109E. It was faster at almost all altitudes, and its engine with fuel injection did not cut out from negative Gs. Emils were armed with cannons which were more effective at greater distances than Hurricanes machine guns; at the same time Emil was better armored than the Hurricane. The only performance advantage the Hurricane had was a tighter turn radius. \nAfter the Battle of France the Hurricanes saw limited service during the Battle of Norway. Then came the famous Battle of Britain. Hurricanes contribution to Germanys defeat cannot be understated. Many historians agree that while Spitfire captured the publics imagination, it was the Hurricane that won the battle. Nearly 57% of all German planes shot down were claimed by the Hurricanes, including 272 Bf-109s. Seven out of 17 best British aces flew the Hurricane.\n12 Hurricane Mk Is were purchased by Finland in February of 1940 after their country was attacked by the Soviet Union. A group of Finnish pilots was sent to Great Britain for training. On February 29th, six fighters flew back to Finland through Sweden. LLv 22 received their first Hurricanes on March 7th. However the Winter War was over in only three days, and no records of Hurricane sorties are known. Out of 12 Hurricanes purchased, only 10 made it to Finland, the other two being lost in transit.\n\nHostilities between the USSR and Finland resumed in June of 1941 when Germany invaded Russia. Finnish Hurricanes claimed five Soviet planes shot down in July of 1941. The few Hurricanes the Finns had usually operated in mixed formations with other fighters. They were mostly used in ground attack or reconnaissance  roles. The last Finnish Hurricane air victory  half a kill was recorded on January 1st 1942. This and the five July kills were the only kills Finnish pilots achieved with the Hawker fighter. In June of 1942 two Hurricanes were used in air defense over Helsinki, where they were also tried in the night fighting role.\n\nThree more Hurricanes were captured from the Soviets in February of 1942. Only one of them was repaired and actually flew. There were also plans to acquire more Hurricanes from Germany. However the Hurricanes poor performance compared to the Brewster B-239 made the Finns change their minds. In 1943 Finland offered their Hurricane fleet to Romania, but the Romanians were not interested.\n\nThere are no known records of Finnish Hurricanes fighting Soviet Hurricanes, and very few engagements with Finnish Hurricanes are recorded on the Soviet side. Pilots of the 65th IAP claimed one Hurricane shot down in November of 1941. Finland has records of two Hurricanes lost in combat. \n\nAll Finnish Mk Is were retired in 1943. Only the single Mk II was repaired in April of 1944, serving briefly as an auxiliary aircraft with LLv 34. The last of the Finnish Hurricanes was retired in May of 1944.\n\nFAF numbers:\nMk I:\nHU451 through 462 (HU461 and HU462 lost in transit). The planes were renumbered HC-451 through 460 in May 1940\nMk IIA:\nHC-465 (captured from the Soviets)\n\nAdvantages: Simple to control. Very easy to maintain and repair in field conditions.

It was still impossible to stop the production of this generally obsolete plane, but there were enough resources to try to modernize it. There were two main areas of improvement: power plant and armament.\nAs early as 1939 Hawker started to experiment with different engines on the Hurricane. British aviation industry was heavily relying on Rolls Royce engines, and a strike on their factories could spell disaster to new aircraft production. Engines from other companies were tried. However, Rolls Royce engines proved superior to their competitors.\nThe most successful results were achieved with the Merlin XX engine with two-stage supercharger rated at 1,185 hp. It was not significantly larger or heavier than the Merlin II or III, but the performance boost was enormous especially at low to medium altitudes. \nMerlin XX was first tried on the Hurricane on June 11, 1940. 565 Km/h was achieved during this test flight. At the same time serial Mk Is could not reach more than 515-530 Km/h. Some modifications were made, mostly minor: enlarged radiator, larger rear view mirror, some equipment, etc. The new Hurricane modification was named Hurricane Mk II and entered serial production in September of 1940.\nNo 111 Squadron was the first to receive the new Mk II's. The planes still had the old Mk I wings and eight MGs. However the planning for twelve MGs began some time before that and only shortage of guns caused the armament to remain the same in the initial run. The fuselage was already remodeled to carry the new wing and armament. The IIA series was basically a transition variant between Mk I and Mk IIB, which entered production in November of 1940. It was finally armed with twelve machine guns and had provisions for 166-liter under wing tanks. These tanks were first tried in May of 1940 for long-range ferry missions. Their construction was modified later to allow maneuvering in combat, and finally the tanks were made jettisonable. \nMuch later Mk IIB's received bomb racks. Hurricanes were gradually replaced with Spitfires in the fighter role so they had to be relegated to ground attack missions. In late April of 1941 Hurricane Mk I was tested with two 113 kg bombs. The test was successful and the air ministry approved the Hurricane for the fighter-bomber conversion. Mk IIB with bombs was successfully tested in May of 1941.\n\nMain Modifications:\nHurricane Mk IIA  Base model. Eight .303 Browning machine guns.\nHurricane Mk IIB  12 .303 Browning machine guns. \nHurricane Mk IIC  Four 20mm Hispano-Suiza cannon. Total of 4,711 built.\nHurricane Mk IID  Tank killer. Two 40mm cannon in under wing gondolas and two Browning MK II machine guns for aiming.\nHurricane Mk IIE  Also known as Hurricane Mk IV. New 1,620 hp Rolls Royce Merlin 24 or 27 engines.

Work in this direction started before the war when the British military attempted to purchase the license from foreign cannon makers Hispano and Oerlinkon. In May of 1939 a Hurricane with twin Oerlikons was tested and later Merlin II variants were also fitted with new cannons. Take-off weight increased to 2,803 kg and top speed decreased to 485 Km/h. This modification did not receive a lot of attention as the Hurricane was considered too weak to carry cannons.\nThese experiments were brought back to life during the Battle of Britain. Plans were made for as many as four 20mm Hispano Suiza cannons. First a Mk I was tested in this configuration, which required a completely redesigned wing. The planes weight was 3,376 kg and top speed a mere 467 Km/h. However, the prototype was a worn out fighter with an old engine. The prototype first flew on June 7 1940, and by August 19th No 151 Squadron received the plane for combat trials. This no known evidence of this plane being used in combat.\nThe first cannon-equipped Mk II flew in February of 1941. It became the prototype for the Mk IIC series. The new Merlin XX engine kept the planes performance on the acceptable level. With take-off weight of 3,680 kg the top speed was at a fair 540 Km/h. Even with tropical filter, which added another 100-some kg to the weight, top speed remained no less than 515 Km/h. \nIn May of 1941 large-scale production of Mk IIC began. By the next month first planes were received by front-line regiments. Although on paper the plane was still a day fighter it was rarely used as such. The inferiority in speed and vertical performance was too great. Hurricanes were relegated to other duties like night fighters, day and night fighter-bomber, short-range reconnaissance and search and rescue plane. This allowed the plane to remain in production for some time.\nHurricane Mk IICs value as a ground attack aircraft was further increased when rockets were installed on under wing racks. It was the first British single-seat fighter to be equipped with such racks, carrying eight UP rockets intended mainly to attack shipping targets. During flight-testing many changes were made to the rocket itself, which increased its combat effectiveness. There were three variants of the rocket in production: armor piercing, high explosive and training. \nThe Mk II was the most important variant of the Hurricane, with many more planes produced than any other mark. The plane served on all fronts of the war. It flew in defense of the British homeland, fought valiantly in the Mediterranean theater, and flew against the Japanese in the Pacific and China-Burma-India Theater. It also served with many of the worlds air forces, including Finnish, Soviet, Indian, Iranian and many others.\nMain Modifications:\nHurricane Mk IIA  Base model.

Pilot armor was increased, and some other minor changes were proposed. The most significant changes were in the armament. Three variants were suggested: four 20mm ShVAKs, twin ShVAKs complemented with two 12.7 UBK machine guns, and four UBTs. The last variant had the best performance due to the guns low weight, however the first two were ordered into production due to their better firepower. Also, the modernization program called for four to six RS-82 under wing rockets.\nThe new armament significantly improved Hurricanes capabilities in both air combat and ground attack. It should be noted that it was used as a Sturmovik rather often. Hurricane with modernized armament could easily carry two FAB-100 bombs without any significant impact in performance. The plane could take a lot of damage; 483rd IAPs A. L. Kozhevnikov once landed with 162 bullet holes in his plane. Many successful ground attack missions were performed. In the summer of 1942 191st IAP flying modified Hurricanes completely obliterated a large transport column near Novy Oskol. In 1942 Hurricanes and IL-2s destroyed 11 fighters and one Ju-52 on the ground. Fighter regiments were often used in ground attack missions, but some Sturmovik regiments also had Hurricanes on hand like the 65th ShAP in the North.\nThe Hurricanes history with the VVS began almost six months prior. It was the first lend-lease plane used by the Soviet air force. On August 28, 1941 24 Hurricane IIBs took off from the British aircraft carrier Argus and landed in Murmansk in Northern Russia near the Artic circle. 15 more Hurricanes joined them soon after, delivered by cargo ships. British pilots protected Murmansk and flew bomber escort for over a month, while at the same training Soviet pilots on the new plane. After that the fighters were handed over to the Northern Fleets 78th IAP VVS. This handful of Hurricanes was then followed by long continuous feed from both British and Canadian factories. \nUnfortunately a lot of Hurricanes, especially from the first shipments, were not new planes but rather worn and used BoB veterans, often with missing parts. Even the Hurricane officially sent to NII VVS for evaluation was old, worn and missing the starter handle, clock and armament. Many British planes, unlike those sent from the US, needed to be refitted or repaired. It was not uncommon for the planes to have 100 hours of flight time and more prior to being shipped to USSR.\nThe Soviet Hurricanes started their service in the North and then started appearing in other areas of the front. First combat engagements exhibited many of Hurricanes shortcomings. The main problem was the armament weak 7.69 machineguns were just not enough to bring down well-armored German planes. Heres a typical example. In January of 1942 three Hurricane IIBs of 191st IAP followed a reconnaissance Ju-88 for almost 10 minutes. All three planes depleted their ammunition and literally filled the Ju-88 with holes, but the German still flew on. \nThe armaments reliability was also not very high. Extreme cold conditions in the Soviet north caused the guns to freeze and refuse firing altogether. Many pilots had to rely on tarans to bring down enemy planes. \nSoviet pilots were not thrilled with the Hurricanes performance. It was slightly faster than the I-16 but slower than the Yak-1. It was still inferior in speed to the 109E and 109F virtually at all altitudes. Hurricanes large airframe acted as an airbrake in dives, which prevented it from outdiving the Germans. It had better turn performance than the Messerschmitt but the Hurricane was not nearly as maneuverable on the horizontal pane as the Polikarpov fighters.\nAnother point of concern was the undercarriage design.  The angle at which the plane could nose over was only 24 degrees, and even less than that for a lighter plane with depleted fuel and ammo supplies. Landing on very rough airstrips made the danger of overturning very high. During nose-overs wooden propeller blades would easily break, and they were almost impossible to repair. The Hurricane could nose over during taxi and take-off as well. It was customary for two mechanics to sit on the tail to hold it down (same as for early Yaks), and then jump off as the plane was taking off. Of course, accidents ensued. In one of them two mechanics were killed, the pilot wounded and the plane lost.\nThe other problem that reduced Hurricanes battle worthiness was the lack of spare parts. The most sorely needed was the airscrew. Wooden blades would break from nose-overs, splinter from bullet hits and get damaged from pellets striking them on rough airstrips. Sometimes as many as 50% of available planes were grounded because they did not have airscrews.  By April of 1942 Soviet factories began producing replacement propellers for the Hurricanes.\nSoviet pilots retraining to the Hurricane had a lot of difficulties to overcome. They had to convert to the different units of measure: miles, feet and gallons as opposed to the familiar kilometers, meters and liters. The strange construction of the flight stick also caused some accidents. \nHowever the plane certainly had its advantages. It was easy to control, and the force required to maneuver even at high speeds was not great. The Hurricane was a very stable plane and even mediocre pilots could perform complicated maneuvers without much difficulty, which was very important during wartime conditions. Most of all, the main advantage over contemporary Soviet fighters was the reliable strong radio on every single plane. Unfortunately the radios were battery powered, even though the plane had an accumulator, and in extreme cold conditions the battery life was less than 1.5 hours.\nIt should be noted than in the winter of 1941-42 when the major part of Hurricanes was delivered to the Soviet Union, VVS had a huge shortage of modern planes. Or course, compared to I-15 or other such alternatives the Hurricane was the miracle of modern aviation. But all that aside, even in late 1941 Hurricanes were clearly inferior to German fighters. Therefore many Soviet mechanics and engineers tried to do their best to somehow improve the planes performance. Many field modifications were made to armament long before the official modernization program began. 7.69 Brownings were replaced with 12.7 UBK machine-guns; racks for RS-82 rockets were fitted, and even twin ShVAK cannons installed. In most regiments the mechanics usually fitted their Hurricanes with 4 to 6 RS-82s. Also the armor was improved. In field conditions the Hurricanes own armor was sometimes replaced with armor seats from I-16s. \nSome problems were encountered when mechanics tried to use water as a coolant instead of glycol. Some modifications were made to the cooling system, but finally Hurricanes were shifted to Soviet antifreezes, which had better low temperature performance.\nBy the summer of 1942 the Haritons as Soviet pilots called them (Hariton is a Russian male name common in the XIX century) were used in large numbers by the Northern and Baltic fleets, and VVS regiments in Karelian, Kalinin, Northwest and Voronezh fronts, as well as numerous PVO regiments throughout the country.\nHurricanes shortcomings of course had ill effects on the planes combat record. Some regiments suffered very heavy losses. For example 3rd GvIAP VVS Baltic Fleet lost most of their planes in a little more than a week while covering the Nevskaya-Dubrovka salient at Leningrad. Insufficient speed and climb rate forced the Soviet pilots to only maneuver in the horizontal. Often Hurricane formations entered defensive circles at the first sight of enemy fighters, not even trying to attack. In 1942 almost 8% of total aircraft losses were Hurricanes, while the type amounted for less than 5% of the total aircraft inventory. \nOf course some of the best Soviet pilots were able to achieve good results with the Hurricane regardless of its shortcomings. There are many examples of outnumbered Hurricane aces shooting down their opponents, and returning home safe. On June 19th, 1942 seven Hurricanes led by G.V. Zimin attacked 12 Stukas protected by 15 Bf-109s and shot down ten planes for the loss of only one of their own. This was however not a typical engagement. Pilot skill alone was simply not enough. \nThe first large scale Hurricane engagements were during the fighting on the Don River leading to the battle of Stalingrad. While Germans often used obsolete planes in the North, they had only the best planes operating in the South. 235th IAD (Fighter Division) that included 191st, 436th and 46th IAPs operated there, all exclusively equipped with Hurricanes. They got to work in June of 1942. During the first week of fighting the division recorded 29 enemy planes shot down. During July the division lost 17 Hurricanes, while claiming at least twice that amount of German planes. However the battle losses could not be replaced with new Hurricanes, and Yaks and Las were sent instead. The division soon was flying Soviet fighters almost without exception.\nThe change was not local. If by July 1st, 1942 VVS had 202 operational Hurricanes, only 130 were still operated by November. They only had an important role in the North; more modern Soviet fighters took over in other areas of the front.\nLater on the Hurricanes were mostly sent to PVO regiments protecting Soviet areas away from the front lines. Hurricane IIC was liked there for its powerful armament of four 20mm cannon. It was absolutely useless against fighters; however it was very effective against bombers. If by July of 1943 PVO regiments had only 495 Hurricanes, by June of next year they had 711. Altogether 252 enemy planes were claimed by PVO Hurricanes during the war.\nThe last Hurricane sortie with the VVS was on May 23rd of 1943. Four pilots of 933rd IAP PVO were directed by radar and located a FW-200 transport plane after flying for 270 miles. The plane made a temporary stop in the steppe. The Hurricanes strafed and set the four-engine plane on fire, and then supported NKVD troops which captured the planes crew.\nThe Hurricane continued to serve with the fleet regiments in the war after it was retired from VVS service. It flew ground attack missions, usually against Luftflotte Vs Scandinavian bases. They also flew night bombing/harassment missions in the same area. \nAfter Germany was defeated, the Hurricanes were retired from front line regiments. USSR did not have to return the planes to England, so they were all sent to junkyards and salvaged for parts. Hurricanes saw very short service as high-speed transport aircraft with the Soviet postal service but did not prove very successful. That was the last chapter in Hurricanes history with the VVS.\nAltogether 3,092 Hurricanes were sent to USSR and 2,834 of them were used by the military aviation regiments. At least 210 Hurricanes IIA were delivered, 1,557 Hurricane IIBs, 1,009 IICs, 60 IIDs and 30 Hurricane IVs. Some Hurricane IIA's were in actuality refitted Hurricane Is. A single Sea Hurricane was used by the Soviet Union after it was launched from convoy PQ18.\n\nAdvantages: Simple to control. Very easy to maintain and repair in field conditions. Reliable and stable in flight. Strong armament.\n\nDisadvantages: Insufficient visibility from the cockpit. Clearly inferior performance to contemporary enemy fighters. \n\n\n

M.\n\nEngine: M-62.\nPower: 1,000 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 366 km/h;\n    At 5,000m: 424 km/h.\nTurn time at 1,000m: 12-13.5 sec.\nClimb to 5,000m: 5.7min. \nService ceiling: 11,000m.\nRange: 600 km.\n\nArmament:\n    4x7.62mm MG (ShKAS), or \n    4x12.7mm MG (BS), or \n    2x20mm cannon (ShVAK).\n\nThe I-153 Tchayka (Sea-gull) fighter was developed in 1938 in the Design Office of N.N. Polikarpov. It was actually a more recent design than the I-16 fighter, contrary to popular belief. The I-153 ("I" for "istrebitel" - fighter) represented a further development of the I-15 aircraft. On the outside, the I-153 looked very much like the I-15. The main dimensions were left the same, the shape of the gulled upper wing was slightly modified, but in contrast to the I-15, the I-153's landing gear was retractable. The M-25 engine was replaced with a more powerful M-62 engine; the whole construction was strengthened accordingly and the pilots seat-back armored. In 1939 the aircraft went into large-scale production. The I-153 became the last mass-produced Soviet biplane. Its design and construction were close to perfect, flight performance was excellent for a biplane; an aircraft of this design and construction could be considered the most perfect of all planes ever built. In the second half of the 1930s, the I-153 belonged to the high-speed aircraft category. However, by the late 1930s, the plane became obsolete before ever going into production. In the early 1940s, its speed became insufficient for a fighter, which were now required to fly at speeds of 500-600 km/h. A biplane simply could not gather such speed. Overall, approximately 3,400 units of the I-153 of various variations were produced.\n\nThe summer of 1939 saw the first combat test of the I-153 in the area of the river Halhin-Gol (Mongolia). It went on to be used in the first years of World War II.\n\nMain variations:\n\nI-153 - Armament: 4 ShKAS machine-guns of 7.76mm caliber.\nI-153BS - Armament: 4 BS machine-guns of 12.7mm caliber.\nI-153P - (P for pushechny - cannon-equipped). Armament: 2 ShVAK of 20mm caliber.\n\nAdvantages: One of the best if not the best mass-produced front-line biplane fighter. High maneuverability. Strong armament.\n\nDisadvantages: Insufficient speed by the year 1941. \n

Each new version brought with it higher speed, ceiling and stronger armament.\nThe I-16 took part in military operations in Spain, China and Mongolia as well as the initial stage of the Second World war. Overall, some 6,555 units of all variations were produced.\nThe I-16 type 18 version was a deep modification of I-16 type 10. There were many changes in construction of the airframe. But the main innovation was the installation of the new more powerful M-62 engine and the propeller with variable pitch. The last series of I-16 type 18 had the same propeller as the I-16 type 24 with M-63 engine.\n\nAdvantages: Serial front-line fighter with excellent performance characteristics. High maneuverability. Good armament for the time. \n\nDisadvantages: Excessive sensitivity of aircraft controls peculiar to all Polikarpov fighters.\n\n\n

Polikarpov. The first flight of the I-16 prototype (Central Design Office-12) was conducted by V.P. Chkalov on December 31, 1933. The I-16 ("I" for istrebitel - fighter) was created as a high-speed fighter, which at the same time pursued the aim to achieve maximum maneuverability in air combats. This fighter distinguished itself via small dimensions resulting in minimum inertia while performing aerobatic maneuvers. In actual fact, the I-16 became quite unstable and required more attention from the pilot since it reacted to the slightest handling. Nevertheless, the I-16 boasted an excellent airspeed. The aircraft was launched into large-scale production in 1934 and underwent numerous modifications. Each new version brought with it higher speed, ceiling and stronger armament.\nThe I-16 took part in military operations in Spain, China and Mongolia as well as during the initial stage of the Second World war. Overall, some 6,555 units of all variations were produced.\n\nAdvantages: Serial front-line fighter with excellent performance characteristics. High maneuverability. Strong armament (for Type 24). \n\nDisadvantages: Excessive sensitivity of aircraft controls peculiar to all Polikarpov fighters.\n\n\n

Instead of two large-caliber and two small-caliber machine guns the I-185 M-82 was equipped with three 20mm ShVAKs. In addition to that the plane also had a redesigned canopy, gear struts and fuselage. Altogether two prototypes were built; the first flew on July 21st 1941. Both I-185 M-82s participated in front-line trials between December of 1942 and January 1943.\n\nAdvantages:\n    Excellent speed characteristics\n    Ease of control\n    Powerful armament\n\nDisadvantages:\n    Slower climb rate than I-185 M-71.\n\n\n
I-185M-71         \n    I-185 M-71 (production standard), 1942\n\nType: multi-role fighter\n\nWeight:\n    Take-0ff: 3,735 kg\n    Full loaded: 3,825 kg\n\nLength: 8.05 m\nWingspan: 9.8 m\nWing area: 15.53 sq. m.\n\nEngine: 1 x M-71\nPower:\n    Take-off: 2,000 HP\n    Indicated: 1,625 HP\n\nTop speed:\n    Ground Level: 600 km/h\n    At 6,170 m: 680 km/h\n\nTime to climb to 5,000 m: 4.7 min\n\nCeiling: 10,000 m\nRange: 835 km\n\nArmament: \n    3x20mm ShVAK cannons\n    500 kg of bombs\n\nThe I-185 prototype equipped with the M-71 engine which first flew on June 10, 1942 was designated a production standard, i.e. a prototype which was to be used as a standard for future production. Compared to other prototypes of the series many defects were resolved and the overall aerodynamics improved. The I-185 M-71 production standard was built from the blueprints intended for serial production. \n\nThe I-185 M-71 production standard, in addition to the I-185 M-71 #6204 and two I-185 M-82 went through front line combat testing between December of 1942 and January of 1943. Speed and climb rate of this prototype were vastly superior to all contemporary Soviet fighters. However due to political reason and lobbying from Polikarpovs enemies the project never entered production and was cancelled. \n\nAdvantages:\n    Excellent speed characteristics\n    Excellent climb rate\n    Ease of control\n    Powerful armament\n\nDisadvantages:\n    Uncomfortable throttle lever\n\n\n
I-250             \n    MiG-13, 1945\n\nType: Mixed Power Fighter\n\nWeight:\n Empty: 2,797 kg\n Maximum: 3,680 kg\n\nLength: 8.19 m\nWingspan: 9.50 m\nWing area: 15.0 sq m\n\nEngine: 1 x Klimov VK-107R V-12, 1 x VDRK Compressor Jet\nPower: 2,560 HP at sea level\n\nTop speed:\n Sea level: 680 km/h\n At 6,600 m: 820 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 11,900 m\nRange: 790 km\n\nArmament:\n 3 x 20mm B-20 cannon (100 shells each)\n Up to 230 kg of bombs\n\nIn mid-1944 Soviet Union initiated a crash program to develop jet or rocket powered fighters to combat the threat of German aircraft like the Me-262. The requirements called for first flights that same year, but the Soviet aircraft designers quickly realized that the state of Soviet jet engine development would not allow for such quick results. Some of the design bureaus given the task instead initiated two simultaneous projects, a longer-term pure jet development, and a quicker stop-gap project of mixed power.\n\nThe MiG design bureaus I-250 was one of these quick solutions. It was powered by a conventional Klimov VK-107R V-12 piston engine, which via an extension shaft drove a compressor with seven fuel burners and a variable rear nozzle, a kind of a propulsive thermojet, in the tail. The airframe was specifically designed with high speed in mind, which dictated the overall small size of the fighter, and the size and profile of the wing. After going through numerous changes on paper, the first prototype was finally completed on November 30th, 1944; it took its first flight on March 3rd of the following year. Only the piston engine was used in the first two test flights; the jet was first fired on the third test flight on April 8th. \n\nSubsequent flights uncovered a host of problems with the jet engine common in jet development prototypes of the time. The 26th test flight of the first prototype on July 5th ended in disaster. The plane reached its never-exceed airspeed in a dive, and at low altitude a part of the left horizontal stabilizer detached. The pilot, Alexander Deyev, managed to bail out, but the parachute had no time to deploy at such low altitudes. The pilot was killed, and the aircraft crashed and burned.\n\nSubsequent flights were rife with other problems. The tail section was strengthened and enlarged by more than 50% to solve various control problems; and the oil radiator was extensively redesigned after its in-flight failure led to a belly lending in a snowy field outside of Moscow. The first serial production I-250 finally rolled off the line in December of 1945.\n\nDue to peacetime conditions, the development pace of the I-250 then slowed down. A second stage of flight tests was ordered, which encountered various other problems. Ten production line I-250s were dismantled in April of 1946, and were fitted with new engines and entirely new wings. The problems continued in the following months. By October the pilots of the 176th IAP finally began training on the eight completed I-250s. However, various problems remained, and the planes never entered front-line service. Finally, by 1948, when the vastly superior MiG-15 was entering production, the I-250 project was cancelled.\n\nAdvantages:\nGood speed characteristics\nPowerful armament\nGood pilot protection\n\nDisadvantages:\nLow reliability of the jet engine\nInsufficient flight time at high speeds\n\n\n
Il-2_1940_Early   \n    Il-2, 1941 model (the first series) - single-seat\n\nType: Ground Attack\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 3,990 kg.\n    Take-off: 5,310 kg.\n\nLength: 11.6m. \nWingspan: 14.6m.\nWing area: 38.5 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: AM-38.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,500 HP;\n    Take-off: 1,665 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 433 km/h.;\n    At 2,460m: 450 km/h.\n\nClimb to 5,000m: 9.2min.\nService ceiling: 7,800m.\nRange: 800 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.62mm MG (ShKAS);\n    2x20mm cannon (ShVAK);\n    16xRS82;\n    Bombs of different weight weighing up to 600 kg.\n\nThe idea of creating a close ground support aircraft - attack plane for hitting enemy troops and military equipment on the battlefield had already emerged in the twenties. The work for developing the technical requirements for such aircraft was entrusted in 1932 to the first section of the Scientific and Technical Committee of Air Forces administration led by Sergei Vladimirovich Ilyushin ("Il"). From this time on, Ilyushin's activity was closely connected with the creation and improvement of armored "Il" attack planes.\n\nIn May 1938, the Ilyushin Design Office set to work on a mainly new attack aircraft combining armor protection and strong armament. Already in 1939, two prototype attack aircraft were constructed, named TsKB-55. It became a prologue to the creation of the famous Il-2 in a way. The main TsKB-55 peculiarity was a smooth armor tub, which was fully inserted in the aircraft fuselage. The tub protected the engine, fuel and oil system as well as two-man crew (pilot plus air gunner) from fire from ground weapons and enemy planes. After completion of the trials, the decision was made to complete the plane and reduce the crew to one. It was anticipated that this reduction of the crew and the plane's subsequently reduced weight would allow it to increase speed and range as well as strengthen its armament and armor protection. In conformity with the new requirements, a new TsKB-57 attack aircraft was developed on the basis of the TsKB-55 in 1940. The modernized attack aircraft had metal fairing in place of the gunner cabin; the rear gunner's place was taken up by a fuel tank. After successful trials, the aircraft's completion was decided before being launched into mass production. The prototype of the series was the second unit of the pilot plane marked TsKB-55P. All prior remarks and criticism were taken into account while developing the construction. To improve cockpit visibility, a new armor frame was designed and produced; it had a modified hood profile and engine placement. A new canopy was designed in line with the new one-seat cabin. The armor tub was shortened and thickened. The aircraft was launched into large-scale production in this configuration under the Il-2 designation.\n\nThe overall number of Il-2 aircraft of all variations produced came up to 36,165 units.\n\nIn May - June 1941, the first serial Il-2 aircraft started being shipped to the ground attack regiments of the VVS (Soviet Air Forces). Already in the first days of the war, the Il-2 proved to be a highly effective weapon, able to successfully deal strikes on motorized and tank columns of the German troops.\n\nAdvantages: Unique attack aircraft of the Second World war possessing excellent performance. Strong armor and fire power. Increased aircraft durability. Simple and easy to grasp the controls. \n\nDisadvantages: No rear hemisphere protection. Oil radiator vulnerability. \n
Il-2_1940_Late    \n    Il-2, 1941 model (2 series) - single-seat\n\nType: Ground Attack\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 3,990 kg.\n    Take-off: 5,310 kg.\n\nLength: 11.6m. \nWingspan: 14.6m.\nWing area: 38.5 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: AM-38.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,500 HP;\n    Take-off: 1,665 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 433 km/h.;\n    At 2,460m: 450 km/h.\n\nClimb to 5,000m: 9.2min.\nService ceiling: 7,800m.\nRange: 800 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.62mm MG (ShKAS);\n    2x20mm cannon (ShVAK);\n    8xRS82;\n    Bombs of different weight weighing up to 600 kg.\n\nThe Il-2 aircraft initially shipped to the ground attack regiments were armed additionally with two 7.62mm machine-guns, two 20mm cannons and provisions for sixteen 82mm rockets. In the course of Il-2 combat use, it turned out that the 16 rocket rails installed under the aircraft's wings considerably reduced flight performance and maneuverability. Thus the decision was made to further produce Il-2 aircraft provisions for 8 rockets without making any changes to the aircraft's construction. In a number of cases, these modernization operations were performed in field conditions on the planes of earlier series by the efforts of pilots and technical staff in the aviation units. \n\nAdvantages: High flight performance. Strong armor and fire power. Increased aircraft durability. Simple and comprehensible controls. \n\nDisadvantages: No rear hemisphere protection. Oil radiator vulnerability.\n
Il-2_1941_Early   \n    Il-2, 1941 model (3 series) - single seat\n\nType: Ground Attack\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 3,990 kg.\n    Take-off: 5,310 kg.\n\nLength: 11.6m. \nWingspan: 14.6m.\nWing area: 38.5 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: AM-38.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,500 HP;\n    Take-off: 1,665 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 433 km/h.;\n    At 2,460m: 450 km/h.\n\nClimb to 5,000m: 9.2min.\nService ceiling: 7,800m.\nRange: 800 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.2mm MG (ShKAS);\n    2x23mm cannon (VYa);\n    8xRS82;\n    Bombs of different weight weighing up to 600 kg.\n\nWhile perfecting the fire power of Il-2 attack aircraft, the Ilyushin Design Office created another Il-2 variation with a new VYa 23mm cannon, which was developed in 1940 by A.A. Volkov (V) and S.Ya. Yartsev (Ya). The 23mm VYa cannon was much more powerful than the 20mm ShVAK. It had a high initial shell speed of 900m/sec (compared with 800m/sec for ShVAK) and a considerably higher shell weight of 200g (96g for the ShVAK). However the rate of fire was lower - 600 rounds per minute (800 rounds per minute for the ShVAK). The new 23mm guns could pierce 25mm armor from a distance of 400 meters. 23mm guns were placed on the aircraft instead of the ShVAK guns and were equipped with special fairings. After successful trials this Il-2 modification was incorporated into its mass production. Already in the summer of 1941, the Il-2 armed with 23mm guns started being shipped to attack aviation units of the Air Forces.\n\nAdvantages: High flight performance. Strong armor and increased fire power. Increased aircraft durability. Simple and comprehensible controls. \n\nDisadvantages: No rear hemisphere protection. Oil radiator vulnerability.\n
Il-2_1941_Late    \n    Il-2, 1941 model (field modification) - two-seater\n\nType: Ground Attack\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 4,130 kg.\n    Take-off: 5,165 kg.\n\nLength: 11.6m. \nWingspan: 14.6m.\nWing area: 38.5 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: AM-38.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,500 HP;\n    Take-off: 1,665 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 420 km/h.;\n    At 2,460m: 440 km/h.\n\nClimb to 5,000m: 11.5min.\nService ceiling: 6,200m.\nRange: 750 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.62mm MG (ShKAS);\n    2x7.62mm MG (DA) or 1x7.62mm MG (ShKAS);\n    2x23mm cannon (VYa);\n    8xRS82;\n    Bombs of different weight weighing up to 500 kg.\n\nThe Il-2's success on the front went hand in hand with great losses of these planes caused by an absence of rear defensive armament.\n\nSoon after mass-produced Il-2 aircraft started being shipped to active ground attack regiments, news started coming from the front that the enemy was being informed of the aircraft's insufficient protection from the rear hemisphere, and had learnt to bring down even this highly armored plane with complete impunity. \n\nThe absence of an air gunner was harmful for the Il-2 in a way. On the battlefields, these aircraft suffered great losses from enemy fighters attacking the Il-2 fearlessly and successfully from the rear unprotected hemisphere without fear for their security. In response, the engineering and technical staff of some army units independently installed machine-gun dummies behind the cockpit of Il-2 planes, thus hoping to reduce probability of enemy fighters attacking from the rear. This did not alleviate the situation. Acting ground attack aviation units started independently remaking the Il-2 into a two-seater. Among the changes introduced were the installation of an air gunner cabin behind the fuel tank placed behind the pilot and outside the armor frame in the fuselage. The air gunner cabin was equipped with a 7.62mm caliber ShKAS machine-gun on a half-turret mounting or a coupled mounting of DA machine-guns (D - Degtyarev, A - aviation) of 7.62mm caliber. The air gunner sat on a canvas rectangle behind the armor partition of the rear fuel tank. This feature allowed maximum aircraft security from enemy fighters attacking from the rear and did not considerably reduce flight performance. The only shortcoming of this variation was the absolute exposure of the rear gunner who sat outside the armor fuselage and was unprotected both from ground fire and shots from enemy fighters. \n\nAdvantages: High flight performance. Strong armor and fire power. Increased aircraft durability. Almost full aircraft protection. Simple and easily understood controls. \n\nDisadvantages: Unprotected rear gunner. Oil radiator vulnerability.\n
Il-2I             \n    Il-2I, 1943 model - single seat\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 4,397 kg.\n    Take-off: 5,383 kg.\n\nLength: 11.6m. \nWingspan: 14.6m.\nWing area: 38.5 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: AM-38F.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,575 HP;\n    Take-off: 1,720 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 415 km/h.;\n    At 2,500m: 450 km/h.\n\nTurn time at 1,000m: 28 sec.\nClimb to 5,000m: 15min.\nService ceiling: 6,500m.\nRange: 700 km.\n\nArmament:\n     2x23mm cannon (VYa).\n\nAdvantages originating from the armor protection and powerful armament of the Il-2 attack aircraft led to the creation of a new variation on its base - a heavy attack aircraft for bomber interception. In 1943 a modified variant of the Il-2I attack plane was developed at the Ilyushin Design Office. It took the standard attack aircraft with the AM-38F engine as the basis. The modification involved wing strengthening, removing of ShKAS machine-guns and rocket rails and abandoning the air gunner and bomb modules located in the center section. The Il-2I's armament consisted of two 23mm caliber VYa guns with an overall ammo capacity of 300 shells.\n\nAlthough the aircraft went successfully through its flight and combat trials, it was not launched into large-scale production because its insufficient speed made the aircraft somewhat vulnerable to enemy fighters. However, the remaking of the old Il-2 single seater aircraft into a fighter was done earlier and independently by the efforts of engineering and technical staff. These planes were for the most part used for escorting regular Il-2s due to a lack of escorting fighters in the first two years of the war. \n\nAdvantages: Strong armor and firepower. Increased aircraft durability. Simple and easily taught controls. Excellent against any enemy bomber.\n\nDisadvantages: Insufficient maneuverability and speed for opposing high-speed fighters. Oil radiator vulnerability.\n
Il-2M_Early       \n    Il-2M 1942 (first series) - two-seater\n\nType: Ground Attack\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 4,260 kg.\n    Take-off: 5,580 kg.\n\nLength: 11.6m. \nWingspan: 14.6m.\nWing area: 38.5 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: AM-38.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,500 HP;\n    Take-off: 1,665 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 396 km/h.;\n    At 2,500m: 426 km/h.\n\nClimb to 5,000m: 14.7min\nService ceiling: 6,200m.\nRange: 740 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.62mm (ShKAS);\n    1x12.7mm (UBT);\n    2x23mm (VYa);\n    4xRS82 or 4xRS132;\n    Bombs of different weight weighing up to 600 kg.\n\nAlthough the Il-2 was independently transformed in the field into a two-seater aircraft, there were still a large number of single seat Il-2s unprotected from the rear. They suffered enormous losses from enemy fighters each day.\n\nAt the beginning of 1942, a conference of front-line attack pilots, Il-2 test-pilots and aircraft designers was held in Moscow for sharing experience of Il-2 combat use and discussing the improvement of its construction. The reiterating proposals of front-line ground attack pilots mostly came down to absolute necessity of producing as standard a two-seater version of the Il-2 equipped with an additional large-caliber machine-gun for parrying fighter attacks from the rear. As a result of the conference, the Ilyushin Design Office was given the task of developing a two-seater Il-2 version with defensive armament and incorporating it in the mass-production without stopping the factory assembly line. A Two-seater Il-2 variant was developed in the short term with minimum modifications to the existing single seat aircraft construction. The standard IL-2 aircraft was completed with another cabin placed outside the armor frame into the fuselage. The air gunner was thus sitting on a canvas belt behind the rear fuel tank's armor partition. He was protected from above with a reclining transparent canopy and with a 6mm armor plate on the front. A defensive large-caliber UBT machine-gun was placed on a half-turret mounting. A simpler but precise VV-1 ring sight was installed instead of the PBP-1B reflex gunsight intended for dive bombers. The aircraft's heavier weight prompted the strengthening of the tail wheel. This weight increase entailed reduced speed performance of the aircraft.\n\nThe spring of 1942 saw the successful testing of the two-seater Il-2; soon the aircraft was launched into mass production and started shipping to the front in ever growing quantities.\n\nAdvantages: High flight performance. Strong armor and fire power. Increased aircraft durability. Virtual full aircraft protection. Simple and easily understood controls. \n\nDisadvantages: Reduction of aircraft speed. Oil radiator vulnerability.\n

The mixed-construction wing represented a metal frame with plywood paneling produced by woodworking plants. \n\nThis constrained modification to the Il-2's construction resulted in a sharp fall in the plane's flight performance. Battle use displayed that Il-2 aircraft with the mixed wing construction lost plywood paneling when diving at high speed (600-700 km/h). This led to accidents and crashes. When plywood paneling was used, the aircraft was short-lived and difficult to repair.\n\nAdvantages: High flight performance. Strong armor and fire power. Increased aircraft durability. Virtual full aircraft protection. Simple and easily understood controls. \n\nDisadvantages: Reduction of aircraft diving speed and maneuverability. Reduced flight performance. Short-lived construction of mixed metal/wooden wing type. Oil radiator vulnerability.\n
Il-2T             \n    Il-2T, 1943 model - two-seater\n\nType: Torpedo Bomber\n\nWeight:     \n    Empty: 4,625 kg.\n    Take-off: 6,160 kg.\n\nLength: 11.6m. \nWingspan: 14.6m.\nWing area: 38.5 Sq.

The guns dismantled were abandoned to reduce the weight of the aircraft which now had to carry a 450mm 45-12-AN torpedo, 5,200mm long and with a combat weight of 900 kg. The torpedo was fastened directly to the Il-2 fuselage in its center line with the help of two special units consisting of a rack mechanism holding the torpedo and two catches for its fixing. The first unit was located in the center of gravity of the aircraft (and torpedo) and was fastened to the lower part of the cockpit's armed shield. The other unit had the same structure and was fastened to the farthest edge of the armored frame. The torpedo release system was launched by blowing up pyrocartridges with electric fuses activated from the bomb holder button in the cockpit.\n\nAdvantages: Effective aircraft for anti-ship operations. \n\nDisadvantages: Oil radiator vulnerability. Lower maximum speed. \n
Il-2_3            \n    Il-2 Type 3, 1943 model - two-seater\n\nType: Ground Attack\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 4,625 kg.\n    Take-off: 6,160 kg.\n\nLength: 11.6m. \nWingspan: 14.6m.\nWing area: 38.5 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: AM-38F.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,575 HP;\n    Take-off: 1,720 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 403 km/h.;\n    At 2,500m: 414 km/h.\n\nClimb to 5,000m: 20min.\nService ceiling: 5,500m.\nRange: 685 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.62mm MG (ShKAS);\n    1x12.7mm MG (UBT);\n    2x23mm cannon (VYa);\n    4xRS82 or 4xRS132;\n    Bombs of different weight weighing up to 600 kg.\n\nThe Ilyushin Design Office was constantly working on improving the Il-2's flight performance. To enhance maneuverability, flight and take-off/landing performance, they started equipping the Il-2 with a more powerful AM-38F engine. The new engine had a take-off power of 1,720 HP, which could be stepped up to 1780 HP for a short time interval. The new engine was also compatible with cheaper low-octane fuel for the Il-2 fitted with the AM-38F engine. A new air filter was installed to enhance the reliability of the boosted engine's operation in conditions of dusty front-line aerodromes. \n\nThe unsatisfactory longitudinal stability observed on two-seater planes became better after the aircraft's center of gravity was moved forward thanks to an increased wing sweep of up to 15 degrees.\n\nThe proposals of front attack pilots were taken into account and the Il-2 started to be produced with a new VUB-3 machine-gun turret which made it possible to fire on the rear hemisphere at large angles.\n\nThanks to the increased output of high-quality aluminum, the Il-2 retrieved its all-metal wings.\n\nAdvantages: High flight performance. Strong armor and fire power. Increased aircraft durability. Virtual full aircraft protection. Simple and easily understood controls. \n\nDisadvantages: Oil radiator vulnerability. \n
Il-2_M3           \n    Il-2 Type 3M, 1943 model - two-seater\n\nType: Ground Attack\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 4,625 kg.\n    Take-off: 6,160 kg.\n\nLength: 11.6m. \nWingspan: 14.6m.\nWing area: 38.5 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: AM-38F.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,575 HP;\n    Take-off: 1,720 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 403 km/h.;\n    At 2,500m: 414 km/h.\n\nClimb to 5,000m: 20min.\nService ceiling: 5,500m.\nRange: 685 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.2mm MG (ShKAS);\n    1x12.7mm MG (UBT);\n    2x37mm cannon (NS-37);\n    4xRS82 or 4xRS132;\n    Bombs of different weight, up to 200 kg.\n\nIn addition to improving the Il-2's flight performance, the Ilyushin Design Office kept working on improving its fighting characteristics. \n\nAs early as 1941, an attempt was made to install 37mm Sh-37 cannon of B.G. Shpitalny design on the aircraft. However, the designers had to give up the idea because of their unreliable operation and cumbersome dimensions. \n\nIn March - April 1943, a new, more perfected 37mm NS-37 cannon developed under the supervision of A.E. Nudelman ("N") and A.S. Suranov ("S") was mounted on a two-seater variant of the Il-2 aircraft with an AM-38F engine specifically for combating new German Tiger tanks. The armor piercing shells fired by these guns could penetrate armor plates up to 40mm thick. The new guns were installed in place of the basic VYa guns and were covered with compact fairings - each of these consisted of two easy-opening folds. Band feeding of the guns was located directly inside the wing and was packed up through upper hatches. Each gun's ammo included 100 armor-piercing and high-fragmentation shells.\n\nWith the installation of the new guns, the weight of the aircraft increased considerably, but it was compensated for by reducing the normal bomb load to 200 kg.\n\nThe two-seater Il-2 attack aircraft with NS-37 cannons was first used against German armored vehicles and motorized columns in the Kursk battle in July 1943. The NS-37 gun proved to be a reliable and powerful weapon, which was especially effective if applied against accumulated volumes of motorized and armored equipment. \n\nAdvantages: High flight performance. Strong armor and fire power. Increased aircraft durability. Virtual full aircraft protection. Simple and easily understood controls. \n\nDisadvantages: Absence of muzzle brakes in the guns leading to strong recoil at firing and difficulties related to conducting aimed fire at pin-point targets with long fire bursts. Lower bomb load. Oil radiator vulnerability.\n
Il-4              \n    DB-3F / IL-4 M-88B, 1941 model\n\nType: long-range bomber\n\nWeight: \n    Take-off: 5,800 kg\n    Fully loaded: 11,300 kg\n\nLength: 14.8 m \nWingspan: 21.44 m\nWing area: 66.7sq m\n\nEngine: 2x M-88B, radial\nPower:\n    Take-off: 1,100 HP\n    Indicated: 950 HP\n\nTop speed:\n    Sea level: 370 km/h\n    At 5,400 m: 430-445 km/h (with 1,000 kg bombs)\nService ceiling: 9,700 m (typical)\nRange: 3,800-4,000 km (3,500 km with 1,000 kg payload)\n\nArmament:\n    2 x 7.62 mm MG ShKAS\n    1 x 12,7 mm UBT\n    1,000 kg  internal bomb load\n    Up to 2,500 kg with both internal and external bomb loads\n\nWith the lack of aluminum for the mass-production of long-range bombers in 1938, a new version of the DB-3  designated as the DB-3F  was built. In reality, it was almost a new plane with mixed metal wooden construction that was very easy to implement in serial production. The plane got a new nose with better aerodynamic form and a larger nose-glassed cockpit. The nose-mounted machine gun was replaced with the twin ShKAS turret MGs and the top tail 7.62mm MG turret was replaced with a modern 12.7mm UBT turret. The trials were completed in June 1939 and, at the end of that year, the plane went into serial production. The new DB-3F plane was later re-designated as the Ilyishin IL-4. \nIn 1942 the M-87 (or M-88A) engine was replaced with the more modern M-88B with two stage superchargers that increased the speed at altitude and the service ceiling.  With the lack of metal, some of the IL-4s produced in 1942 got wooden spars in the wings, but later  at the end of 1942  they were again replaced by metal.\nThe IL-4 and the DB-3, together with long-range bombers Yer-2 and Pe-8, were used in August 1941 in bombing raids against the German capital and other cities. The IL-4 was widely distributed in VVS bomber regiments and naval aviation on all fronts. One Black Sea, Baltic Sea and North Sea naval aviation IL-4 was used in a torpedo bomber version. This version was capable of taking two types of torpedo for attacks from low (45-36-AH, 940kg) and high (45-36-AV, 940kg) altitudes. To increase flight time, racks for an additional drop tank were installed under the rear part of fuselage.\nOften it was possible to see the IL-4 flying in mixed formations together with the A-20 and B-25 Lend Lease bombers .\n\nMass production of the IL-2 ended in 1944. In total, 5,256 aircraft of several modifications were built. \n\n3 of the captured IL-4s were in service with the Finnish Air Force. \n\nMain modifications:\nIL-4 with M-88A engines\nIL-4 with M-88B engines with new two stages superchargers \nIL-4T  torpedo bomber\n\nAdvantages:. Good payload and range. Excellent maneuverability for a 2-engine bomber.\n\nDisadvantages: Hard to control the aircraft over a long flight time. No autopilot. Version with wooden tail part of fuselage was easy burning target. Not enough armament for the defense.     \n\n\n

The new design would utilize recent Soviet experience in sturmovik usage as well as general advances in aircraft design. \n\nThe sturmovik designs were based on the IL-1 single-seat heavy fighter prototype. The IL-1 heavy interceptor proved a very promising design; however as it was being fleshed out the need for a heavy fighter disappeared, and Ilyushin decided to create a new sturmovik based on the IL-1 instead. At the same time, several other sturmovik prototypes were being worked on, all potential heirs to IL-2s throne. The leading contender up to that time was the IL-8 prototype, however IL-1s performance was so impressive that the new IL-10 Sturmovik was based on the IL-1, and incorporated many of the improvements created for the IL-8.\n\nInitially Ilyushin offered to build two sturmovik prototypes, a single-seat version and a two-seater. However by late October Ilyushin himself decided that only the two-seater prototype would proceed. The new aircraft was a significant improved compared to the IL-2. Special attention was paid to streamlining the airframe and improving the speed characteristics: the wings were reduced in size with a high-speed wing profile chosen, IL-2s landing gear gondolas were deleted, the tail wheel made retractable, and many other changes combined to increase IL-10s top Sea Level speed by as much as 150 km/h compared to the IL-2.\n\nBy late April of 1944 the new sturmoviks, at the time still designated the IL-1, began flight testing. The results were excellent. The heavy plane was almost as fast as the latest fighters, and could enter maneuvering dogfights with them on virtually equal terms. At the same time the design was similar to the IL-2 and required virtually no familiarization training; the official report stated that only three-four hours and 10  15 landings would be required to retrain IL-2 crews. The prototype was also a very stable gun platform; however it was more difficult to take-off and land than the IL-2 due to the increased speed. \n\nThe state trials ended on June 9th, 1944, and on August 23, 1944, defeating all competition, the new sturmovik went into serial production. First VVS units began receiving their IL-10s in January of 1945, however only three regiments saw limited service in the war with Germany. The third of them, the 118th Guards ShAP, became operational on May 8th of 1945, the same day Germany surrendered. The new Sturmovik proved quite successful; only one was shot down by an enemy fighter, and another FW-190 was claimed shot down by an IL-10 in a dogfight.\n\nIL-10s also saw action in the Soviet war with Japan in Manchuria, with a Navy regiment that mostly attacked coastal targets near the Korean Peninsula. \n\nAfter WWII the IL-10 went on to become the mainstay ground attack plane of the Soviet Block countries. They were used in the Korean war, and stayed in active service with some air forces until as late as 1972.\n\nA total of 6,226 IL-10s of all variants, including license-built by Soviet allies, were produced during the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n\nMain Variants:\nIL-10  initial production variant\nB-33  post-war license-built Czech variant\nIL-10M  radical 1951 all-weather redesign with improved armament and on-board equipment\n\nAdvantages:\nExceptional top speed for an attack aircraft\nExcellent maneuverability\nStrong on-board armament\n\nDisadvantages:\nLight bomb load\nMore difficult take-offs and landings than on the IL-2.\n\n\n\n\n
LaGG-3series4     \n    LaGG-3, model 1941\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 2,516 kg; \n    Take-off: 3,346 kg.\n\nLength: 8.81 m.\nWingspan: 9.80 m.\nWing area: 17.62 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: M-105P.\nPower: 1,050 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 498 km/h;\n    At 5,000m: 575 km/h.\n\nTurn time at 1,000m: 20 sec.\nClimb to 5,000m: 6.8min. \nClimb in a combat turn: 750m.\nService ceiling: 9,500m.\nRange: 870 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.62mm MG (ShKAS);\n    1x12.7mm MG (BS);\n    1x20mm cannon (ShVAK).\n\nDeveloped by the Experimental Design Office led by S.A. Lavochkin (La), V.P. Gorbunov (G) and M. I. Gudkov (G), the LaGG-3 represented a further I-301 development (later LaGG-1). The LaGG-3 was a front-line fighter, an all-wooden monoplane with a closed canopy and retractable gear. It differed from the LaGG-1 through the availability of two additional fuel tanks installed in the wings of the aircraft. These additional fuel tanks led to an increase in the aircraft's take-off weight, resulting in the modernization of its landing gear. \n\nIntroducing the LaGG-3 into the series was rather difficult - the aircraft was far from perfect and was being improved in parallel to the mass production. The LaGG-3 was produced with different armament variants. The mass-produced LaGG-3 carried armament consisting of a ShVAK cannon (sometimes replaced by the 12.7mm caliber BK machine-gun or the Vya-23 23mm cannon), one or two BS MGs and two ShKAS MGs. Up until 1942, the standard LaGG-3 armament also included six RS-82 rockets. There were also serial variants with a 37mm Sh-37 cannon designed by the Shpitalny bureau and an NS-37 cannon of Nudelman and Suranov design. The LaGG-3 with the 37mm gun was called the "tank destroyer". Thus, due to its powerful ammo, the LaGG-3 was for the most part used for bomber interception.\n\nOverall, 6,528 LaGG-3 units of all variations were produced until being withdrawn from production in 1944.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent performance characteristics for that time period. High maneuverability and strong armament. Long range. Increased aircraft durability.\n\nDisadvantages: Rather long revision of the aircraft in the course of large-scale production. Low-quality treatment of the fuselage and wing surface, non-retractable tail wheel in the first series provoking reduction of speed characteristics. Poor rear visibility. First serial planes prone to fall into spin eliminated in 1941 with the introduction of automatic leading edge slats. Quick loss of speed in continuous maneuvers.\n
LaGG-3IT          \n    LaGG-3 IT, 1942 model\n\nType: Fighter/Ground Attack\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 2,832 kg; \n    Take-off: 3,363 kg.\n\nLength: 8.81m.\nWingspan: 9.80m.\nWing area: 17.62 Sq. M.\n\nEngine:M-105PF.\nPower: 1,180 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 510 km/h;\n    At 3,950m: 560 km/h.\n\nTurn time at 1,000m: 22 sec.\nClimb to 5,000m: 7.2min. \nClimb in a combat turn: 850m.\nService ceiling: 9,600m.\nRange: 650 km.\n\nArmament:\n    1x12.7mm (BS);\n    1x37mm (NS-37).\n\nThe LaGG-3 IT (IT for "istrebitel tankov" - tank destroyer) was developed by designer M.I. Gudkov and represented a modification of the mass-produced LaGG-3 aircraft, whereby the basic 20mm cannon was replaced with a 37mm cannon designed by Shpitalny and later with a 37mm NS-37 cannon designed by Nudelman and Suranov. The first three LaGG-3 IT planes (marked K-37) were produced in 1941. Initially, the plane was fitted with a 37mm Shpitalny cannon with a 20 shell capacity from an anti-aircraft mounting of the same caliber. After internal trials all three aircraft were sent to the front. In the course of combat use, the K-37 showed wonderful results - its 37-mm cannon pierced the upper and rear armor plates of all existing enemy tanks. In 1942 the K-37 was launched into large-scale production under the reference LaGG-3 IT (sometimes LaGG-3-37). From 1943, the LaGG-3 IT was equipped with a 37mm NS-37 cannon designed by the Nudelman and Suranov bureau.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent performance characteristics. High maneuverability and strong armament. Increased aircraft durability.\n\nDisadvantages: Insufficient rear cockpit visibility. Quick loss of speed in long-drawn maneuvers. Insufficient maximum speed for the year 1943.\n

The aircraft received a perfected M-105PF engine instead of the M-105P. The LaGG-3 of later series carried an M-105PF2 engine, which resulted in speeds at sea level of 554 km/h and at 3,400m- of 618 km/h. The weight of the aircraft was considerably reduced due to changes in the armament, equipment and construction. All the disadvantages discovered in the LaGG-3 of the first series were also eliminated.\n\nPlanes of this version took part in air battles until the end of the Second World war, including the knock-out blow on Japan.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent aircraft flight performance. High maneuverability and strong armament. Increased aircraft durability.\n\nDisadvantages: Insufficient rear visibility. Quick loss of speed in continuous maneuvers.\n

The aircraft was developed as the next LaGG-3 version. The La-5 was built in the shortest possible time in the Experimental Design Office of S.A. Lavochkin in conjunction with the LaGG-3s withdrawn from production in most factories. The fighter was based on the mass-produced LaGG-3 modified version. \n\nFor more info, please read the La-5FN section of the view object menu.\n\nAdvantages: Good performance characteristics. High maneuverability and strong armament. Good visibility from the cockpit.\n\nDisadvantages: The heavy weight of the aircraft does not allow engine power to be used to the full.

La-5FN            \n    La-5FN \n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 2,828 kg; \n    Take-off: 3,290 kg.\n\nLength: 8.67m.\nWingspan: 9.80m.\nWing area: 17.50 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: M-82FN.\nPower: 1,850 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level (with 10-minute boost): 583 km/h;\n    At 6,250m: 634 km/h.\n\nTurn time at 1,000m: 18.5 sec.\nClimb to 5,000m: 5.2min. \nClimb in a combat turn: 1,100m.\nService ceiling: 10,750m.\nRange: 650 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x20mm cannon (ShVAK).\n\nThe La-5FN was an improved version of the La-5 aircraft. \n\nIt was one of the main Soviet fighters during the Second World war. The aircraft was developed as the next LaGG-3 version. The La-5 was built in the shortest possible time in the Experimental Design Office of S.A. Lavochkin in conjunction with the LaGG-3's withdrawal from production in most factories. The fighter was based on the mass-produced LaGG-3 modified version. The La-5 differed from its predecessor through considerable structural improvements, which essentially enhanced the aircraft's flight performance. The La-5 used several variants of a more powerful air-cooled radial M-82 engine. The fuselage and wing construction was the same as that of the LaGG-3 of the late modernized series. The standard hunchback style canopy was replaced with a new bubble canopy with front and rear armored glass providing for observation of the rear hemisphere. In the course of its large-scale production, the expensive delta-timber used for structure construction was replaced with the more common pine (it caused no considerable changes in the weight of the aircraft), and since 1944 wing spars were made of metal.\n \nThe La-5FN was equipped with a more powerful M-82FN engine (ASh-82FN) with fuel injection and a take-off power of 1,850 HP. Apart from its modernized power plant, the La-5FN had lighter landing gear, better cockpit thermo-insulation, lower control column and rudder pedal resistance. \n\nAs a result of all the improvements, the La-5FN fighter considerably outstripped the German Me-109G and FW-190A fighters in terms of speed at low and medium altitudes and in terms of vertical and horizontal maneuvers.\n\nThe first large-scale combat use of the La-5FN planes occurred in summer of 1943 during Battle of Kursk. Prior to this the first La-5 fighter regiments successfully participated in the Battle of Stalingrad. Some 10,000 La-5, La-5F and La-5FN fighters were produced overall during the war years.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent performance characteristics. High maneuverability and strong armament. Full combat superiority over the period's most recent German aircraft at low and medium altitude. Good visibility from the cockpit. Increased aircraft durability.\n\nDisadvantages: Heavy weight of the aircraft not allowing to use engine power to the full. Wooden construction of the first serial aircraft.\n
La-7              \n    La-7 \n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 2,605 kg; \n    Take-off: 3,265 kg.\n\nLength: 8.67m.\nWingspan: 9.80m.\nWing area: 17.59 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: ASh-82FN.\nPower: 1,850 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level (with speed-up): 612 km/h;\n    At 6,000m: 680 km/h.\n\nTurn time at 1,000m: 18 sec. \nClimb to 5,000m: 4.5 min. \nClimb in a combat turn: 1,200m.\nService ceiling: 10,750m.\nRange: 635 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x20mm cannon (ShVAK) or \n    3x20mm cannon (B-20).\n\nThe La-7 was a further enhancement of the La-5FN aircraft. Although there were only slight differences in size and silhouette between the La-7 and the La-5, the La-7 had one essential structural distinction: wing spars made of metal (as on the most recent La-5FN series). Ribs and paneling were left unchanged. Spar size was considerably diminished to free up additional space for the fuel tanks. Spar weight was reduced to approximately 100 kg. Aircraft aerodynamics was also considerably improved through the transfer and improvement of the radiator's aerodynamic forms (this feature distinguishes the La-7 from the La-5 on the outside). All these improvements gave the La-7 the edge over the La-5 in speed, rate of climb and service ceiling. The armament could consist of either 2 ShVAK cannons or 3 B-20 cannons of 20mm caliber.\nSome 5,735 La-7s were produced up until the end of the Second World war.\n\nAdvantages: One of the best serial front-line fighters of the end of the war with excellent flight performance. Improved aerodynamics. High maneuverability and strong armament. Absolute combat superiority over most of the latest piston-engined German, English and American fighters at low and medium altitude. Increased aircraft durability. Simple and easily teachable controls.\n\nDisadvantages: The culture of production was slightly inferior than that of "Yak" fighters of the end of the war and it was necessary to ensure weight reduction for wooden parts of the glider. As a result, the all-metal La-9 aircraft was created.\n

La-7R             \n    La-7R, 1945\n\nType: Mixed-Power Fighter\n\nWeight:\n Empty: 2,703 kg\n Take-off: 3,500 kg\n\nLength: 8.67 m\nWingspan: 9.8 m\nWing area: 17.59 sq m\n\nEngine: 1 x Shvetzov ASh-FN\n\t1 x Glushkov RD-1X3\nPower: 1,850 HP; 300 kg/s at sea level\n\nTop speed:\n At 6,300 m: 795 km/h\n\nClimb rate: 1,340 m/min\n\nService Ceiling: 13,000 m\n\nArmament:\n 2 x 20mm ShVAK cannon\n\nWhen Soviet units first encountered Luftwaffe jets and rockets, the Soviet high command was shocked to find that they were so far behind the German technological edge. Soviet design bureaus and factories were years away from being able to produce adequate opposition. The Soviets did possess leading-edge rocket technology, surpassing that of the Germans, but the general level of Soviet aviation industry did not yet produce a battle-worthy airframe that could be powered by such engines. The decision was made, as a stop-gap measure, to strap small rockets to existing piston-engine fighters. This measure was expected to increase the top speed and climb rate of these fighters to make them more competitive with the German jets.\n\nLavochkin design bureau was one of the several ordered to produce mixed-power prototypes. Initial tests were conducted with the Glushkov RD-1 rocket engine. Aviation Factory #381 in Moscow that produced La-7 fighters was chosen by Lavochkin as the development site for the new project. A standard edition La-7 was taken off the production line and re-designated La-7R-1. The modifications were numerous: the tail section was redesigned to fit the rocket engine; existing fuel tanks were swapped for kerosene and acid tanks, with corresponding wing and fuselage sections remade out of aluminum and stainless steel to prevent corrosion from the highly volatile fuels. \n\nThe fuel pump for the rocket engine was hooked up to the piston engine in the nose; in the initial flight tests the system proved troublesome, and was thoroughly reworked. The tests were conducted by taking-off and climbing to 3,000 m on piston power alone, and then engaging the rocket engine while in the air and letting it run through the entire fuel supply. In most tests the rocket engine did not perform well, and would often shut down by itself. The project team was unable to isolate the problem. When the engine did work, it increased the top speed of the fighter by as much as 85 km / h. \n\nA few weeks later another La-7 joined the program as the La-7R-2, this one created out of the 51st production series, more aerodynamically clean than the airframe used for the R-1. This prototype performed better, but still in fifteen out of forty-five flights the rocket engine refused to work. \n\nBy July of 1945 a new rocket engine was ready, the RD-1X3. The engine was a significant improvement over the RD-1, with additional starter and fuel pumps, improved starting procedure, and other enhancements. Between July and September of 1945 more test flights were conducted with the new engine, which performed better than the old version, and shut down on start-up only twice.\n\nAdvantages:\nExcellent maneuverability\nStrong armament\n\nDisadvantages:\nUnreliable rocket engine\nInsufficient time of flight\n\n\n
Li-2              \n    Li-2, 1939 model\n\nType: Transport/Bomber\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 7,650 kg;\n    Take-off: 10,700 kg.\n\nLength: 19.65m. \nWingspan: 28.81m.\nWing area: 97.10 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: 2xASh-62IR.\nPower: 1000 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 275 km/h.;\n    At 1,700m: 295 km/h.\n\nClimb to 3,000m: 16.7min.\nService ceiling: 5,600m.\nRange: 2,150 km.\n\nArmament:\n    3x7.62mm (ShKAS);\n    1x12.7mm (UBT).\n    Bombs of different weight suspended under the center section weighing up to 2,000 kg.\n\nThe Li-2 was a reproduction of the American Douglas DC-3 (US army designation C-47) aircraft developed in 1935 in the USA by the Douglas Company. Many countries, among them the USSR, bought a license for DC-3 production. The aircraft was widely acknowledged for its extremely low production costs, simplicity of construction and reliability in maintenance. The remaking of the design using domestic technology and the conversion of measures into the metric system was supervised by aircraft designer V.M. Myasischev. In mid-1938, large-scale production of the DC-3 (marked PS-84) started and that of the Li-2 as of September 1942 ("Li" stands for the name of the chief factory engineer - B.P. Lisunov - who supervised aircraft production at the time).\n\nThe plane could also be used as a passenger and transport plane, but stood out due to its economy, reliability and simple use. There were several Li-2 variations with different engines, equipment parts and armament.\n\nIn the war years, the Li-2 was used as night bomber, transport and passenger plane. This flexibility allowed a wide range of tasks to be assigned to it. At the beginning of the war, these entailed transportations for the most part; the same aircraft would often carry back the wounded. The Li-2 also served as an airborne troops carrier.\n\nParadoxically, the slow passenger aircraft turned out to be a rather good bomber. This success was a result of rightly chosen tactics concerning its use and features. In long-range aviation, the Li-2 was used for the most part as a night bomber.\n\nThe Li-2 was used throughout the Second World war and post-war years. Some 4,870 Li-2 units of all variations were produced in the USSR in the course of its large-scale production.\n\nAdvantages: Good flight performance. Multifunctionality. Reliability. Simple and easily taught controls. \n\nDisadvantages: Weak armament. No crew intercom. \n
MBR-2-AM-34       \n    MBR-2, 1937 model\n\nType: Maritime Reconnaissance\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 2,718 kg.\n    Take-off: 4,000 kg.\n\nLength: 13.5 m. \nWingspan: 19.0 m\nWing area: 51.0 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: 2xAM-34NB\nPower:\n    Indicated: 750 HP\n    Take-off: 830 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 238 km/h;\n    At 5,000 m: 245 km/h.\n\nClimb to 3,000 m: 21 min.\nService ceiling: 7,150 m.\nRange: 800 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.62 mm MG (ShKAS);\n    Bombs of different weight with an overall weight under 200 kg.\n\nThe Soviet designers confronted the problem of creating aircraft capable of carrying out short-range tactical reconnaissance near to naval bases when aviation was still in its early stages. Until the middle of the 20s, boats the M-5 and M-9 flying boats created by the Experimental Design Office of D.P. Grigorovich were successfully used to these ends. However by the end of the 30s, the requirements for short-range sea reconnaissance aircraft had moved on considerably. They presupposed the availability of defensive gun armament and small caliber bombs. The crew could not consist of less than three men to ensure effective operation. Additionally, range and altitude had to be much higher than the corresponding parameters in the M-5 and M-9.\n\nThe design of the sea ("Morskoy") short-range ("Blizhniy") reconnaissance ("Razvedhik") MBR-2 aircraft was entrusted to the design group led by G.M. Beriyev. Developed in 1932, the MBR-2 represented a three-seat flying monoplane-boat with a BMW-VI engine (later on the M-17) installed above the wing center section at the center of gravity and equipped with a four-blade propeller. This engine placement was used for the first time and proved to be reasonably cost-effective, which led to its acknowledgement by many aircraft designers of that time. The plane construction was all-wood, rather simple and cheap to produce. The wing consisted of two box-shaped spars, frame ribs and panel sheeting. On-board armament consisted of two turrets with DA machine-guns placed in the front and middle tail units of the boat. A bomb load of 500 kg could be hung up on the outer racks under the wing. \n\nDuring the trials, the MBR-2 boasted a high margin of safety, good stability in the air and on water, simple controls as well as reliability and modest maintenance requirements. \n\nIn 1932, the MBR-2 was adopted by the Soviet naval aviation and launched into large-scale production at the Taganrog aircraft works where the Experimental Design Office for sea aircraft construction was set up, to be led by G.M. Beriyev.\n\nIn the course of the production of the aircraft, a modernized MBR-2 version was developed in 1935. It came with a more powerful AM-34NB engine (or lower altitude AM-34N). Regular DA machine-guns were replaced with more rapid-firing ShKAS turrets. However the installation of a new heavier engine required that the bomb load be reduced to 200 kg.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the MBR-2 was used as an anti-submarine and reconnaissance aircraft; as a bomber, the MBR-2 sank small enemy vessels and transporters and dealt fatal strokes on infantry in coastal areas. Several dozens of the planes were produced in a special version for interaction with torpedo boats and their radio control.\n\nIn all, some 1,470 MBR-2 planes of all variations were produced.\n\nAdvantages: Good flight performance. Simple and easy controls. No splashing into crew cabins on take-off. Good maneuverability. Excellent seaworthiness. Low cost price and simple production.\n\nDisadvantages: Low speed. High load on the wing. High aerodynamic resistance. Impossibility of independently leaving the water. \n
MiG-3             \n    MiG-3, model 1940-41\n\nType: Interceptor\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 2,770 kg\n    Take-off: 3,718 kg\n\nLength: 8.25 m \nWingspan: 10.2 m\nWing area: 7.44 Sq.

The design office established as a result of this co-operation is still known as MiG from the initials of its creators. The first development took root in the competition launched by the Soviet Air Forces to create a new high-altitude interceptor which was to be equipped with an inline V12 engine designed by Mikulin. The aircraft designed by Mikoyan and Gurevich won the trials conducted within the guidelines of the competition. This was the MiG - 1 (initially marked I-61). However, the aircraft was not flawless and only 100 units were built. The list of shortcomings included inadequate stability caused by the rear center of gravity, low range, low durability and higher pilot workload compared with other planes; the aircraft was prone to spins and always had difficulty recovering from a spin. As a result, a new interceptor version - the MiG - 3 appeared featuring enhanced aerodynamics. Furthermore, fuel capacity, armament and armor thickness were increased. Overall, 3,422 planes (including the small MiG-1 series) were constructed.\n\nThe MiG-3 was employed on the fronts in 1941-1943 (in Bryanschina, Kuban, Moldavia and the Crimea). It was this very aircraft that the top Soviet ace Alexander I. Pokryshkin was flying when he gained his first victory by shooting down a Messerschmitt Bf-109E.\n\nAdvantages: The fastest large-scale high-altitude interceptor in 1941. High static stability in pitch. Excellent responsiveness in high angles of attack maneuvers. Good maneuverability at high altitudes (over 6,000m). Excellent repair abilities. Practical, feasible production.\n\nDisadvantages: Weakly armored. High landing speed - not less than 144 km/h. Insufficient maneuverability at low altitudes and long turn time at low altitudes (by Soviet Air Force standards).\n

This aircraft distinguished itself via an elongated fuselage, which gave it high static stability in pitch, and enhanced quality of processing surfaces, junctions and joints. A number of other minor modifications were introduced to upgrade the aircraft's aerodynamic features. As a result, the MiG-3 met the standards set by the reference prototype, and even surpassed them in some areas.\n\nThe MiG-3 was adopted up until the end of the war and lingered on in some Air Force units for a long time after the war was over. \n\nMain advantages and disadvantages are the same as in MiG-3.\n

This aircraft distinguished itself via an elongated fuselage, which gave it high static stability in pitch, and enhanced quality of processing surfaces, junctions and joints. A number of other minor modifications were introduced to upgrade the aircraft's aerodynamic features. As a result, the MiG-3 met the standards set by the reference prototype, and even surpassed them in some areas.\nOne of the modifications that were done was the replacement of the MG armament. 315 MiG-3s were produced with two 12,7mm BS instead of the standard type of armament - one 12,7mm BS and 2x7,62mm ShKAS.\n\nAdvantages: The fastest large-scale high-altitude interceptor in 1941. High static stability in pitch. Excellent responsiveness in high angles of attack maneuvers. Good maneuverability at high altitudes (over 6,000m). Excellent repair abilities. Practical, feasible production.\n\nDisadvantages: Still weakly armored. High landing speed.

But generally this modification had the same performance and flight parameters as the standard armament version.\n\nAdvantages: The fastest large-scale high-altitude interceptor in 1941. Very good armament for that time. High static stability in pitch. Excellent responsiveness in high angles of attack maneuvers. Good maneuverability at high altitudes (over 6,000m).

MiG-3-AM-38       \n    MiG-3AM-38, 1941 model\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 2800 kg\n    Take-off: 3800 kg\n\nLength: 8.45 m\nWingspan: 10.2 m\nWing Area: 17.44 sq m\n\nEngine: AM-38\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,500 hp\n    Take-off: 1,665 hp \n\nTop speed:\n    Sea level: 547 km/h\n    At 3400m: 592 km/h\n\nTurn time at 1,000 m: 21 sec\nClimb to 3,000 m: 3-3.2 min\nClimb in a combat turn: 1000 m\nRange: 800 km\nService ceiling: 8000 m\n\nArmament:\n    2 x 12.7mm MG (BS)\n    2 x 7.62mm MG (ShKAS)\n\nThe first attempt to install similar the low altitude IL-2's AM-38 engine was done in summer 1941 year in the MiG design bureau. Such a low altitude (below 4,000m) fighter was requested by VVS for escorting ground attack planes (IL-2 and Su-2). With the more powerful AM-38 engine the serial MiG-3 reached 592 km/h at 3,400 m altitude. But the installation of such a powerful engine and without changes to the cooling system made it possible for a very short time, especially at summer.\nWith the abandoned production of the AM-35A engines there was a serious problem with lack of engines for repaired aircraft, in different regiments, in winter 1941-42. There were many attempts to install AM-38 engine by troops. Such installation wasn't hard due to similar size and almost similar weight to the AM-35 engine. Possibly from 5 to 20 units of MiG-3 were equipped with such engines in different regiments by ground crew. The historical sources don't give us exact numbers, but there are many accounts by pilots and ground crew about such installations and successful use in battle. \n\nAdvantages: The fastest low altitude fighter in 1941. High static stability in pitch. Excellent responsiveness in high angles of attack maneuvers. Excellent repair abilities. \n\nDisadvantages: High landing speed. Insufficient maneuverability at low altitudes and long turn time at low altitudes (by Soviet Air Force standards, comparing say to Yaks).\n\n\n

It had the same AM-35A engine, but with two synchronized ShVAK guns, new wooden fuselage (except for the engine-holding frame), improved water radiator thermodynamics, the shifting of oil radiator suction pieces from the fuselage to the roots of the wing, lightweight gear and other improvements. The MiG-3U boasted a better performance than the serial MiG-3 thanks to improved aerodynamic forms and reduced weight.\n\nThe question concerning the recommencement of large-scale MiG-3 production was brought up at the end of 1942, however it was acknowledged inexpedient at a time when the large-scale production of Yak and La fighters was ever on the increase. All six aircraft constructed at the experimental plant were sent to the Kalininsky front where they operated without losses for a long time. \n\nRepair plants sometimes mounted 20mm guns on standard MiG-3s instead of machine-guns by analogy with the MiG-3U. They were designated as MiG-3Us in some document sources.\n
MiG-9protoF-2     \n    MiG-9, 1946\n\nType: Jet Fighter\n\nWeight:\n Empty: 3,533 kg\n Maximum: 4,988 kg\n\nLength: 9.75 m\nWingspan: 10.0 m\nWing area: 18.2 sq m\n\nEngine: 2 x RD-20 (BMW-003)\nPower: 2 x 800 kg/s\n\nTop speed:\n Sea level: 864 km/h\n At 5,000 m: 910 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 13,000 m\nRange: 800 km\n\nArmament:\n 1 x 37mm N-37 cannon (40 shells)\n 2 x 23mm NS-23 cannon (160 shells each)\n\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, development of jet engines in the Soviet Union proceeded at an excellent pace, and Soviet designers like Arkhip Lyulka created prototypes equal or better than contemporary British and German designs. However the German attack in June of 1941 put those projects on the backburner. Lyulka was sent to work on tank engines, and other jet engine designers were sent to various other projects, separating the teams and stopping the projects cold. \n\nHowever, in early 1944 Soviet intelligence received strong indications that jet development still continued at full pace in Germany and Great Britain, and the decision was made to restart Soviet jet programs. Alexander Yakovlev was put in charge of jet development, with the requirement calling for Soviet jet planes taking to the air that same year. \n\nUnfortunately the Soviet industry was unable to produce an indigenous jet engine before the end of the war. The best prototype, Lyulkas TR-1 with projected thrust of 1,250 kg was troublesome; however captured German engines like Jumo-004B with 900 kg of thrust, and BMW-003 with 800 kg, were in Soviet hands with complete manufacturing blueprints. A decision was made, as a stop-gap measure, to begin production of these engines until Lyulkas prototype was perfected.\n\nIn June of 1945 the Mikoyan design bureau (OKB-155) began the development of a single-seat fighter powered by twin RD-20 engines (Soviet-manufactured BMW-003s). Following a failed I-260 prototype, MiG decided against placing the engines under the wings, and instead installed them in the fuselage. The new project was designated I-300. The airframe mock-up was built in the fall of 1945, and in late December the first prototype was ready. For the next four months the planes various components were tested on the ground, and on April 15th of 1946 the airframe was finally taken for a very brief flight, just a few meters off the ground. On April 24th the first full-blown flight was made, with the aircraft performing very well.\n\nSubsequent test flights were plagued by engine vibrations and control problems caused by uneven thrust. Various changes to the engine mount and the airframe were made, and by mid-May the test schedule became so hectic that the entire flight team was ordered to live right next to the runway, in a couple of train cars hauled to the area. The vibration continued to be a problem, with the design team divided as to the potential causes. Artem Mikoyan decided to follow on all suggested courses at the same time, and the combination of TsAGI tests and serious redesigns of the engine mount finally fixed the problems. A test flight on June 17th showed remarkable improvements in all problem areas.\n\nOn July 11th of 1946 the new aircraft was to be exhibited for high-level Soviet officials that included the head of the VVS and the minister of aviation industries. The I-300 was to be flown following aerobatic displays by the captured He-162 and Yakovlevs competing Yak-15. Both jets performed complex routines over the airfield; the I-300 had not yet been tested in high-G maneuvers, and was not supposed to perform them for the committee. However the chief test pilot of the I-300 A. N. Grinchik decided to out-perform the Yak-15, and performed various maneuvers at low altitude above the airfield. The plane was seen struggling with high Gs, and on a high-speed pass after the maneuvers parts of the wing were seen to detach from the plane, and the prototype inverted, crashed and burned. Grinchik was killed. \n\nThe investigation showed that the wing construction was unfit for high-G maneuvers, and therefore multiple changes were made to the airframe. Subsequent flight tests went without serious problems, and by October the prototypes went to the final stage of trials, the armament tests. First production aircraft were already on the assembly line, and by late October were ready for acceptance by the VVS. Flight crews were also already being prepared, by flying captured Me-262s at NII VVS.\n\nDue to peace-time conditions, flight testing continued at a slow pace throughout the next two years. MiG-9 proved unable to combat piston-engine fighters in maneuvering dogfights; however it could outrun them, and proved adequate for its intended role as a bomber interceptor. In total, almost 600 MiG-9s were produced between 1946 and 1948. The production stopped when the next generation MiG fighter entered production, the famous MiG-15. By 1951 most of the MiG-9s were sent to China, where they widely used alongside the MiG-15 in the Korean air war.\n\nAdvantages:\nPowerful armament\nExcellent speed characteristics\n\nDisadvantages:\nInsufficient maneuverability\n\n\n

MiG-15(bis)       \n    MiG-15Bis Fagot (MOD), 1949 Model\n\nType:  Fighter\n\nWeight:  4,960 kg\n\nLength:  10.11 m  \nWingspan:  10.08 m  \n\nEngine:  Klimov VK-1\nPower:  \nTake off: 5,951Lbs Thrust\n\nSpeed at Military mode:  \nSea level: 1,076 km/h (668 Mph)\nClimb to 10,000m: 4.9 min\nService ceiling:  15,500 m  (50,853 ft)\nRange:  1,200 Km  \n\nArmament:  1xN-37mm Canon and 2xNR-23mm Machine Guns\n\nThe MiG-15Bis, Soviet Union/Russia was one of the most successful swept wing aircraft of the Korean War A.K.A Fagot a code name designated not by the Russians but by NATO. It was originally intended to be a high altitude bomber interceptor, hence the large calibre guns, however it proved to be an excellent fighter as well. It was developed around the same time as the F-86 and was inspired by the German Ta-183 with its T shaped tail. The MiG-15 was an unpleasant surprise to the West when it appeared during the Korean war, far more superior in climb, armament and high speed high altitude maneuverability than any thing the West had and it was not until 1953 that the West had a fighter to fight this on near equal terms. Earlier pilots being Korean and Chinese proved easy pickings for the experienced well trained USAF pilots. The two aircraft were such a match that the skill of the later Russian and USAF pilots determined the out come of the fights.\n\nThe fighter was very light giving it a much higher thrust to weight ratio than the F-86 which in swept wing jet fighters is just as important as something like turn performance. It allowed the MiG-15 to out accelerate and recover from fights quicker than the F-86 but not out dive. The MiG-15 was plagued by compressibility thus locking all controls making this aircraft dangerous in the dive. It could fly at supersonic speeds but its tail design limited it to Mach 0.95, these affects are apparent due to PeterDs high transonic affects. The use of the MiG-15Bis was opted for as the boosted controls would make this more of a fighter than a turkey shoot to Sabre pilots.\n\nThe MiG-15Bis was an improved version of the MiG-15 and received these improvements 3 months after the MiG-15 was built.\n\nRolls-Royce Nene engine reproduced without license as the Klimov VK-1 producing 5,952lbs of thrust, with a top speed of 668Mph TAS (1,076Km/h TAS) at sea level and a climb rate of 9,842ft/min (50m/s). It incorporates air brakes, boosted control surfaces giving it a roll rate of 90 degrees a second (4 seconds to complete a roll, half the speed of the F-86!). The MiG-15Bis had a service ceiling just above 50,000ft and would regularly use this advantage against the F-86s during the Korean War. It uses 2x23mm machine guns and 1x37mm canon. This aircraft is also plagued by the famous flat spin outs.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent climb rate and high altitude high speed maneuverability, effective canon against bombers and fighters.\n\nDisadvantages: Could not fly faster than the speed of sound, speeds near mach 1.0 caused fish tailing and complete loss of control, the aircraft did not handle very well at low speeds. High landing speed.

High landing speed.
MiG-17            \n    MiG-17F Fresco C (MOD), 1953 Model\n\nType:  Fighter\n\nWeight:  5,354 kg\n\nLength:  11.09 m  \nWingspan:  9.63 m  \n\nEngine:  Klimov VK-1F\nPower:  \nTake off: 5,732Lbs Thrust Dry\nAfter burner: 7,451Lbs Thrust\n\nSpeed at Military mode:  \nSea level: 1,108 Km/h (689 Mph)\nAt 3,048: 1,150 Km/h (715 Mph)\nClimb to 10,000m: 3.7 min\nService ceiling:  16,470 m  (54,035 ft)\nRange:  1,080 Km  \n\nArmament:  1xN-37mm Canon and 2xNR-23mm Machine Guns\n\nDespite its similarity to the MiG-15 it is a new fighter with a much steeper swept wing. This is not the same variant that was used in the Vietnam War; the Fresco C used in the Vietnam War had an improved climb rate of 75m/s. This aircraft was around during the Korean War, however was intended to see action in the Korean War but was vetoed by Stalin, possibly to keep their most advanced fighter to them selves for the time being.\n\nIt has similar maneuverability to the MiG-15Bis but has a much larger air brake, modest increase in roll rate, faster climb and generally more nimble. Although using an afterburner this offered little advantage in top speed but provided a larger thrust to weight ratio and climb rate. The afterburner is only limited to short periods of use due to overheat and fuel consumption. At a continuous afterburner the aircraft will consume its entire fuel in less than 25 minutes. The aircraft had very short legs and almost always carried drop tanks.\n\nUsing the Klimov VK-1F after burning engine producing 5,952lbs thrust dry and 7,452lbs of thrust with reheat. It has a top speed of 689Mph TAS (1,108Km/h TAS) at sea level and 715Mph TAS (1,150Km/h TAS) at 10,000ft. Climb rate of 12,795ft/min (65m/s). Range 770 miles (385 miles Combat Radius) and a service ceiling of 54,053ft (16,475m). This variant was able to reach Mach 1.0 in level flight however still had problems with control at higher speeds. Versus an F-86F-25L they will be near equals at high speed maneuverability but the Sabre still has the advantage at low speed and high speed control.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent climb rate and high altitude high speed maneuverability, effective canon against bombers and fighters. Can fly at the speed of sound\n\nDisadvantages: Any Speed in the excess of mach 1.0 causes some loss of control, the aircraft did not handle very well at low speeds. High landing speed.

Only five years later, when they saw combat for the first time, German Bf- 109 and Bf-110 fighters hopelessly outclassed them. Still, with skill and determination, Polish pilots were able to attain a remarkable number of victories, and the plane's sturdiness, maneuverability and good handling qualities helped them stage a defiant resistance under the most adverse of circumstances. Though accurate counts are sketchy, the actual number of German aircraft shot down by fighter pilots in the short campaign was probably around 105-110, to the loss of only 26 P.11s to air-combat. Given the enormous technical and numerical advantage of the Luftwaffe, these numbers show the excellent skills and determination of Polish fighter pilots and their trust in the machine that carried them into battle. \nThe P.11c was an aerodynamically clean high-wing monoplane of all-metal construction. The characteristic bent "gull-like" shape of the wings was adopted to reduce drag by eliminating the need for any supporting structure between the center section and the fuselage.\nThe aircraft had one PZL Bristol Mercury VS2 engine driving a wooden 2-bladed Szomanski propeller.\n\n\n

Hawk-75s were mainly delivered to France, where it was the second most common French fighter after the M.S.406, with 291 aircraft. French Hawk-75s hold the honor of being the first Allied plane to shoot down a German fighter (September 8, 1939). Altogether the French Hawks claimed at least 230 Luftwaffe planes for the loss of 29 of their own.\nHawk-75A-3 was an improved version of the A-1 and A-2. The main difference was the 1,200 HP R-1830-S1C3G engine. Hawk-75A-3 was also one of the variants of the P-36 which France sold to Finland after the armistice. Altogether Finland received 36 Hawk-75s of the A-1, A-2 and A-3 sub-variants. Also a few Hawk-75s found their way to England, where they were designated Mohawk-III. The British got about 20 Hawk-75s. \nA very interesting British study compared the Hawk-75-A-2 with the Spitfire I. Surprisingly, the export P-36 proved superior to the famous fighter in some aspects, including dive characteristics, cockpit visibility and landing and take-off behavior. \n\nMain Variants:\nHawk -75A-1 R-1830-CS-G engine rated at 950 HP on take-off. Four 7.5mm machine guns.\nHawk-75A-2 - R-1830-C2G engine rated at 1050 HP.

Five assembled by Indian Hindustan factory. \nHawk-75A-6  12 planes ordered by the Norwegian air force. Only a part was delivered before Norway capitulated. R-1830-S1C3G Twin Wasp Engine at 1,200 HP was used. All Norwegian Hawk-75A-6s were sold to Finland.\nHawk-75A-8  Another Norwegian order, this one for 36 planes with 1,200 HP R-1820-G205A engines. None reached Norway in time. Most were bought by the USAAF and designated P-36G. Armament was two .50 cal and four .30 cal Browning machine guns. \n\nAdvantages:\nGood visibility\nStrong early-war armament\nEasy to pilot\n\nDisadvantages:\nObsolete by 1940\n\n\n

Overall it was very similar to the A-3, but instead of the 1,200 HP R-1830-C3G engine a R-1820-G205A of the same horsepower was used. The new engine was shorter and larger in diameter than the predecessor, and therefore the Hawk-75A-4s nose was redesigned. There were some other minor modifications, most notably special additions to the gun ports. \n795 A-4s were ordered, only 284 were built, and only six reached France. At least one Hawk-75A-4 was captured by the Germans, and it was likely sold to Finland. Majority of the planes built were sent to Great Britain (190 planes), where they were designated Mohawk-IV. 7.5mm machine guns were replaced with .303 Browning, and the control column was replaced. Later 72 Mohawk-Ivs were given to South Africa and India. 12 more were used by Portugal.\n\n\nMain Variants:\nHawk -75A-1 R-1830-CS-G engine rated at 950 HP on take-off.

P-38F (factory designation Model 222) incorporated many upgrades including factory drop tank/bomb racks and was the world's first fighter aircraft delivered by air across a major ocean. The P-38F and P-38G Lightnings reached Europe in July 1942. Beginning with the P-38F-1-LO the wing center section was strengthened to allow wing pylons to carry drop tanks and bombs up to 1000lbs. under each wing. Although this variant had stronger engines the added structural weight resulted in roughly the same performance as the P-38E. Beginning with the P-38F-15-LO,which was in production alongside the P-38G, combat flaps were added. Allison V-1710-49/53 engines, which previously could only give 1,150 HP, were now producing 1,325 HP but due to poor fuel grades in Europe engine power was limited to 1150 HP. Operations in the Pacific and Mediterranean were not typically flown at the high altitudes as in Europe therefore P-38's did not have as many engine problems in these theaters.\nMain Variants:\nP-38F; 210 built.\nP-38F  Wing pylons for fuel tanks and bombs; 126 built.\nP-38F-1-LO  Numerous aircraft converted for projects BOLERO,BRONZE and SUMAC; 151 built.\nP-38F-5-LO  Projects BRONZE and SUMAC. 100 built.\nP-38F-5-LO  improved electric systems. 1,400 built.\nP-38F-13-LO  additional equipment modifications; 29 built.\nP-38F-15-LO  maneuver flap setting introduced; 121 built.\nF-4-1-LO  First high-performance photo-reconnaissance aircraft for USAAF to be mass produced , 99 built.\nF-4A-1-LO  high-performance photo-reconnaissance aircraft, 20 built.\n\nAdvantages:\nFast speed\nLong range\nPowerful armament\nCondiserable bomb load for a fighter\n\nDisadvantages:\nModerate roll rate at high speeds.\n\n\n

P-38H (factory designation Model 422) incorporated many upgrades including new turbos and automatic engine and radiator controls. Allison V-1710-89/91 engines, which previously could only give 1,325 HP, were now producing 1,600 but technical orders in Europe limited takeoff power output to 1,325 HP with a combat rating of 1500 for 5 minutes at high altitudes. This was mainly due to insufficient grade and quality of fuel which the wing leading edge intercoolers were having trouble coping with on the new high powered engines at high altitudes and pilot ms-management of the engines. Many pilots disregarded the technical orders and had the stops removed from their engines so they could get full power if needed in an emergency. This was the last of the early P-38 type airframes which were slightly lower in drag than P-38J and subsequent variants.\nMain Variants:\nP-38H; 600 built.\nP-38H-1-LO  ; 226 built.\nP-38H-5-LO  ; 375 built.\n\nAdvantages:\nFast speed\nLong range\nPowerful armament\nConsiderable bomb load\n\nDisadvantages:\nModerate roll rate at high speeds (rectified by installation of aileron boosters on J-25 and subsequent variants)\n\n\n

It was determined that placing radiators under the engine was the best solution. \nAs such, the new shape of the engine housing became the most significant external difference. It increased drag somewhat, but it more than paid of in increased power. Allison V-1710-89/91 engines, which previously could only give 1,240 HP, were now producing 1,425. As the result the P-38J was the fastest P-38 Lightning model.\n\nMain Variants:\nP-38J-1-LO  pre-series test variant; 10 built.\nP-38J-5-LO  additional fuel tanks in the front section of the wing; 210 built.\nP-38J-10-LO  increased pilot protection in the shape of an armored front cockpit glass. 790 built.\nP-38J-15-LO  improved electric systems. 1,400 built.\nP-38J-20-LO  additional equipment modifications; 350 built.\nP-38J-25-LO  variant with aileron boosters, 210 built.\nP-38J Droop Snoot  glass nose cone, a bombardier position and either a Norden bombsight, or a Mickey BTO (Bombing Through Overcast)  bombing radar.\nF-5B-1-LO  photo reconnaissance, 280 built.\n\nAdvantages:\nFast speed\nLong range\nPowerful armament\nConsiderable bomb load\n\nDisadvantages:\nProblematic control at high speeds, especially in dives (rectified by installation of aileron boosters on J-25 and further variants)\n\n\n

The plane was also used to create the P-38M night fighter, equipped with the SCR540 night radar. These entered service towards the end of the war.\n\n\nMain Variants:\nP-38L-1-LO  initial variant, virtually identical to the P-38J-25-LO, the only exception being the engines. 1,290 built.\nP-38L-5-LO  most common variant, with 2,520 examples built.

The fighter was built in such a way as to carry weapons of the largest caliber ever installed on a one-engine aircraft of the time. It was armed with a 37mm T9 cannon - developed by the American Armament Corporation - which fired through the propeller hub, and two synchronized 12.7mm caliber Browning machine-guns installed in the forepart of the fuselage. The engine had to be installed inside the fuselage behind the cockpit to place a gun of this caliber. The air propeller was started with the help of a shaft placed under the cockpit floor.\n\nHowever, powerful armament availability was not the only concern for the designers working on the new fighter. Along with its fire power, they had to provide for aircraft operation at any time of the day and on ill-prepared runways. With the engine placed behind the cockpit, Bell designed a tricycle landing gear with a steerable nose wheel enabling taxing at high speed, take-off and landing on unprepared surfaces without the risk of the aircraft tipping over. Except for the hydraulic brakes, all XP-39 systems (later P-39) came with an electric drive. The cockpit was very practical and comfortable.\n\nAfter the trials, the aircraft was completed and launched into large-scale production bearing the name P-39. In the course of production, a great number of modifications were made concerning the armament, engine, air propeller type, fuel reserve and other features. It is worth pointing out that "Airacobra" became increasingly perfected with each new modification.\n\nThe N version of the "Airacobra" (P-39N, P-39N-1 and P-39N-5 series) differed from the previous modifications in terms of improved flight performance due to a reduced fuel reserve (325 l) and weaker armor protection. This version of the P-39 saw the introduction of the new Allison V-1710-85 engine (power 1,200 HP) and Aero Prop propeller. The aircraft's armament consisted of a 37mm T9 cannon, two 12.7mm machine guns in the nose and four wing-mounted 7.62mm Browning machine guns. Overall, 2,095 aircraft of this variation were produced.\n\nThe Airacobra was shipped to the USSR under the lend-lease program. Altogether, the Soviet Union received approximately 4,750 P-39 aircraft of D, N and Q variations.\nGood flight performance at low altitudes allowed the Airacobra to be used effectively for escorting Il-2 attack planes and protecting them from enemy fighters, bomber intercepts as well as ground attack. Contrary to popular belief, Soviet Union never used P-39s in ground attack role.\n\nAdvantages: One of the best mass-produced front-line fighters of the Second World war with excellent performance characteristics. Excellent aerodynamics. High maneuverability and strong armament. Increased aircraft durability. Simple controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Tendency to fall into spin. \n
P-39Q-1           \n    P-39Q-1 "Airacobra", 1942 model\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 2,854 kg;\n    Take-off: 3,714 kg.\n\nLength: 9.07 m. \nWingspan: 10.36 m.\nWing area: 19.9 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: Allison V-1710-85.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,200 HP;\n    Take-off: 1,420 HP\n\nSpeed:\nSea level: 520 km/h.;\nAt 3,500m: 616 km/h.\n\nTurn time at 1,000m: 19,5 sec.\nClimb to 6,000m: 8,1 min\nClimb in a combat turn: 950m.\nService ceiling: 9784m.\nRange: 1,046 km.\n\nArmament:\n    1x37mm cannon (T9); \n    2x12.7mm MG (Browning .50 cal).\n    2x7.62mm MG (Browning .303 cal): wing.\n\nThe P-39Q became the next version of the "Airacobra" after the P-39N. Once the mass-produced P-39 aircraft were shipped to the USSR, Soviet Air Forces advised Bell to improve the aircraft's construction. Indeed, during violent maneuvering, P-39 fighters suffered deformations of panels in the aft fuselage and tail assembly, which in most cases could not be restored. Stabilizer spar breakages were also observed and these led to crashes and accidents. The Airacobra's improvement was carried out by Bell constructors together with the largest center of Soviet aviation science at the time - The N.E. Zhukovsky Central Aero Hydrodynamic State Institute (TsAGI) and the Scientific and Research Institute of the Air Forces. The trials conducted showed that American durability standards did not meet Soviet Air Forces requirements. Research carried out in TsAGI premises served as a basis for the development of measures for strengthening and changing the construction of the shipped P-39 planes by specialists of the Central Scientific and Experimental Air Forces base. The result of this work was the development of further Airacobra versions baptized P-39Q (P-39Q-1 and P-39Q-5 series). This version differed from the previous ones in terms of strengthened fuselage and armament which now consisted of a 37mm T9 cannon, two 12.7mm machine-guns and two 12.7mm Browning machine-guns installed in the wing. Overall fuel supply came up to 416 liters. In all, some 1,100 aircraft of this variation were produced.\n\nAdvantages: One of the best mass-produced front-line fighters of the Second World war with high flight performance. Improved aerodynamics. High maneuverability and strong armament. Increased aircraft durability. Simple and easy-to-use controls.\n\nDisadvantages: While reduced, the tendency to fall into a spin remained.\n
P-39Q-10          \n    P-39Q-10 "Airacobra", 1942 model\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 2,854 kg;\n    Take-off: 3,714 kg.\n\nLength: 9.07 m. \nWingspan: 10.36 m.\nWing area: 19.9 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: Allison V-1710-85.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,200 HP;\n    Take-off: 1,420 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 540 km/h.;\n    At 3,500m: 640 km/h.\n\nTurn time at 1,000m: 18-19 sec.\nClimb to 5,000m: 5,9 min.\nClimb in a combat turn: 1000m.\nService ceiling: 9,784m.\nRange: 1,046 km.\n\nArmament:\n    1x37mm cannon (T9).\n    2x12.7mm MG (Browning .50 cal).\n\nThe P-39Q-10 represented a further development of the Q series P-39 aircraft.\nIn contrast to the previous series, some planes of this version had a four-blade propeller. The same propeller was used in some batches of the Q-1 and Q-5 series. Beginning with the Q-21 and Q-25, the aircraft was using a four-blade propeller. However Soviet pilots had already learnt how to remove the wing-mounted 12.7mm machine-guns in field conditions with the help of technical staff to achieve better flight performance, increasing maneuverability and especially vertical speed of the aircraft. Bell took into account numerous requests made by Soviet pilots and, starting from the Q-10 series, equipped the P-39 with a 37mm T9 cannon and two 12.7mm Browning machine-guns in the nose. In general, compared to the Q-1 series, the aircraft's base structure was left unchanged. However, the gains in speed and maneuverability became quite considerable, even if combined with an old engine. The regiments where these planes were adopted would often partially remove armor protection as they did on the previous series to lighten the aircraft; this subsequently produced gains in speed and vertical maneuverability. \n\nAltogether, some 705 units of the Q-10 series were produced.\n\nAdvantages: One of the best serial front-line fighters of the Second World war featuring a high flight performance. Improved aerodynamics. High maneuverability. The tendency of falling into spin in maneuvers at low speed was considerably reduced. Increased aircraft durability. Simple and easy to grasp the controls. \n\nDisadvantages: Reduced armament on the aircraft. \n

It served on every front with virtually every Allied air force. The P-40 started as a modification of the Curtiss Wrights successful Hawk 75 (P-36) fighter. After several radical redesigns a more simple approach was used. Hawk 75s radial engine was replaced with an Allison V-1710 radial engine, while the rest of the aircraft behind the engine essentially remained the same. This prototype exhibited significant increase in performance. It was still not as good as the competitors (P-39, P-38 and P-43  future P-47), but it was cheaper and could be produced almost immediately, so it was ordered. It was obvious that the war was rapidly approaching the United States and USAAC quickly needed to increase the number of their aircraft, so 524 P-40s were ordered right away in the largest peacetime order in US history. P-40s began to enter US service in May of 1940.\nP-40s were also sent to the British, which requested some changes, most importantly armor protection for the pilot. Initial production P-40s lacked any armor protection or self-sealing fuel tanks. The improved version, designated P-40B, also entered US service in the spring of 1941.\nThe next version was designated P-40C. Its most significant exterior change was provisions for a droptank which greatly increased the fighters range. It could also carry bombs.\nThe British version of the P-40 designated Hawk-81-A reached worldwide fame when it was sent to the American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force, also known as the Flying Tigers. Under the direction of General Claire L. Chennault they reached significant success flying against Japanese Armys Ki-27 fighters and bombers in the defense of Chinese air space.\n\n\nAdvantages: The P-40 was a sturdy aircraft and could endure a great deal of punishment. More maneuverable than any other US aircraft at the time of Pearl Harbor. Easy to control.\n\nDisadvantages: Largely obsolescent by any standards even before it was ordered into production.\nToo slow, low climb rate. Still outmaneuvered by the Zero. \n\n\n\n

The improved version, designated P-40B, also entered US service in the spring of 1941.\nThe next version was designated P-40C. Its most significant exterior change was provisions for a droptank which greatly increased the fighters range. It could also carry bombs.\nThe British version of the P-40 designated Hawk-81-A reached worldwide fame when it was sent to the American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force, also known as the Flying Tigers. Under the direction of General Claire L. Chennault they reached significant success flying against Japanese Armys Ki-27 fighters and bombers in the defense of Chinese air space.\n\n\nAdvantages: The P-40 was a sturdy aircraft and could endure a great deal of punishment. More maneuverable than any other US aircraft at the time of Pearl Harbor. Easy to control.\n\nDisadvantages: Largely obsolescent by any standards even before it was ordered into production.\nToo slow, low climb rate. Still outmaneuvered by the Zero. \n\n\n\n\n
P-40E             \n    P-40E Warhawk, 1941 model\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 2,880 kg  \n    Maximum: 4,173 kg\n\nLength:  9.50 m\nWingspan:  11.38 m\nWing area:  21.92 sq m\n\nEngine: Allison V-1710-39\nPower: 1,150 hp\n\nTop speed:\n    At 1,524 m: 539 km/h\n    At 3,050 m: 555 km/h\n    At 4,570 m: 583 km/h\n    Landing: 130 km/h\nTurn time at 1000 m: 19.5 sec\nClimb rate to 6,100 m: 11.5 min\nService ceiling: 8,840 m \n\nRange:  \n    Normal: 1,046 km\n    Maximum: 2,414 km\n\nArmament:\n    6 x 12.7 mm MG\n    1 x 227 kg (500 lb) bomb\n    2 x 45 kg bombs\n\nAs P-40s wartime experience increased, Curtiss made many modifications to the earlier variants of the fighter. Armor plate was added, as well as better self-sealing fuel tanks, and more powerful engines. Due to the introduction of the new Allison V-1710-39 engine the two guns in the engine cowling were deleted. The cockpit was modified to improve visibility and the armament was changed to six wing-mounted .50-caliber machine guns, as opposed to only four machine guns in the earlier models.\n\n1,500 were built, primarily for the RAF where they were designated Kittyhawk Mk I. Many were also diverted to Canada, Australia, Russia, and New Zealand. Based on the Lend-Lease regulations all aircraft purchased with US funds had to have standard US designations and had to be issued USAAF serial numbers, even though they were never intended for service with the USAAF. \n\nOverall, most pilots who flew the P-40 did not like it. One of the major gripes the US and RAF pilots had with the Warhawk is its altitude performance, which was a direct result of the pre-war bombardment over pursuit design policy. Soviet pilots did not fight at altitude very often, but they also found that P-40 engines were not very reliable and that it could not withstand battle damage as well as the P-39 Airacobras. Many modifications were made to the P-40 and it remained in production until 1944; however it was hardly a fighter pilots dream and was generally outclassed by the enemy fighters all throughout its history.\n\nAdvantages:  Increased firepower over earlier P-40 with the addition of six 0.50-caliber machine guns.  The P-40E was a sturdy aircraft and could endure a great deal of punishment.  \n\nDisadvantages:  Despite the addition of the Allison V-1710-39, it was too slow, lacked maneuverability, had a low climb rate, and was largely obsolescent by any standards even before it was ordered into production.\n\n\n
P-40E-M-105       \u0020\n    P-40E Soviet Modification with M-105P Engine, 1942 model\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: ~2,700 kg  \n    Maximum: ~4,000 kg\n\nLength: 9.50 m\nWingspan: 11.38 m\nWing area: 21.92 sq m\n\nEngine: Klimov M-105P\nPower:  1,100 hp\n\nTop speed:\n    Sea level: 476-480 km/h\n    At 4,800 m: 560-565 km/h\nClimb rate to 5,000 m: ~7.5 min\nService ceiling: ~9,000 m    \nRange: unknown\n\nArmament:\n    6 x 12.7 mm MG\n    up to 6 x RS-82 Rockets\n    1 x 250 kg bomb\n    2 x 50 kg bombs\n\nThe Soviets made several modifications to the lend-lease P-40s they've received. The most notable was the 1942 modification where the original Allison V-1710-39 was replaced with the Soviet-built Klimov M-105 engine. In addition to the new engine, the modified P-40 also received the VISh-61P propeller. \n\nThe main reason for the modification was not that the Allison engine proved unsatisfactory, or that the Klimov engine provided a performance boost. Soviets had a shortage of spare parts for the Allison, and a large portion of their P-40 fleet remained grounded for long periods of time. Soviets chose to replace the Allison with one of the most popular engines at the time, the M-105. The same engine was powering many of the early to mid-war Soviet fighters: Yak-1, Yak-9, Yak-3 and LaGG-3 all used the M-105, as well as the Pe-2, Ar-2 and Yer-2 bombers. The M-105 was similar to the Allison in performance, horsepower and even dimensions. It was also very familiar to most Soviet ground crews. \n\nOverall, the modification was a very welcome improvement on the logistical front with many overall advantages and few, if any, disadvantages. It however did very little in the area of P-40s combat performance, and its flying characteristics remained basically the same. Approximately 40 P-40s were refitted with the M-105 engine, all used by the 196th IAP at Lake Ladoga. The Soviet-modified P-40s can be recognized by the special adapter disk around the spinner.  \n\nAdvantages:  Same as P-40E.\n\nDisadvantages:  It was too slow, lacked maneuverability, had a low climb rate, and was largely obsolete by any standards for modern fighters.\n\n\n
P-40M             \n    P-40M Warhawk , 1942 model\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 2,939 kg\n    Loaded: 3,629 kg\n    Maximum: 4,037 kg\n\nLength: 10.16 m\nWingspan: 11.38 m\nWing area: 21.92 sq m\n\nEngine: Allison V-1710-81\nPower:\n    At 17,300 ft: 1,125 hp\n    Take-off: 1,200 hp\n\nTop speed:\n    At 1,524 m:  496 km/h\n    At 3,050 m:  515 km/h \n    At 6,100 m:  582 km/h  (362 mph)\nClimb to 6,100 m:  7.5 min  \nService ceiling:  9,145 m\nRange:  \n    With 500 lb bomb: 350 miles  \n    Maximum: 1,600 miles\n\nArmament:\n    6 x 12,7mm MG \n\nBy the late 1942, the scarcity of Packard-built Rolls Royce engines used on the P-40F necessitated that the Allison engine to be reintroduced into the P-40 production line. The result was the P-40K and P-40M versions.\n\nThe P-40M was generally similar to late-production P-40Es except for the more powerful Allison engine. The P-40M was initially to retain the short fuselage of the P-40E, but first batches of P-40K had a tendency to swing during takeoff due to increased power. Therefore late production P-40K and P-40M had a dorsal fin, and the longer fuselage first introduced on the P-40F-5-CU. The P-40M was also adapted for combat in cold weather. \n\nThe first P-40M appeared in November 1942. Most of them went to the RAF, the RAAF, Russia, and the RNZAF as the Kittyhawk III. The type served with British Commonwealth forces in the Far East. No. 5 Squadron of the South African Air Force operated a number in Italy. \n\nAdvantages:  Increased performance over earlier P-40 variants combined with good durability.\n\nDisadvantages:  Weak firepower and roll performance.\n\n\n
P-47D-10          \n    P-47D-10 Thunderbolt model 1941\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight:  \n    Empty:  4520,3 kg \n    Loaded: 6129 kg\n\nLength: 11.03 m  \nWingspan: 12.4 m  \n\nEngine: Pratt and Whitney R-2800-59\nPower: 2,300 hp\n\nTop speed:  \n    Sea level: 536,1 km/h \n    At 9000 m: 697 km/h\nClimb rate to 6,100 m: 11.5 min  \nService ceiling: 12,800 m \nRange: 3,060 km  \n\nArmament: 8 x .50 Cal (12.7 mm) MG\n\nNicknamed "The Jug," the P-47 was a big and very powerful high-altitude fighter.  The P-47D was the first version of the Thunderbolt to undergo large-scale production. The first USAAF order for the P-47D took place on October 14, 1941, when 850 examples were ordered. However, it would be followed by many, many more. \n\nIn its initial form, the P-47D differed very little from the P-47C, which preceded it. The P-47D had some changes in the turbo supercharger exhaust system that incorporated an adjustable duct and redesigned vents for the engine accessory section. Additional cowl flaps were fitted to provide engine-cooling airflow. More extensive armor protection was provided for the pilot. Generally, however, early P-47Ds can be distinguished from Cs only by their serial numbers. \n\nToward the end of 1943, Eighth Air Force Thunderbolts began returning from escort missions over the Continent "on the deck", seeking out enemy ground targets of opportunity for their unused ammunition as they made their way back to the Channel. Somewhat surprisingly, it was found that the Thunderbolt was rather well suited for this new role. This led to perhaps the most successful adaptation of the Thunderbolt--as a fighter-bomber. \n\nP-47D-10 Thunderbolts had the original framed sliding canopy that was first used on the P-47B.\n\nThe high diving speeds of which the Thunderbolt was capable of pushed the aircraft into the edge of compressibility. From the P47D-27 and on blunt-nosed ailerons were fitted to improve controllability at these high speeds and in order to help in dive recovery at these high speeds, an electrically operated dive recovery flap was fitted on the undersurfaces of each wing.  \n\nThe P-47D-10 production block had only ventral shackles, which were stressed to accommodate one 500-lb bomb, but subsequent production blocks were fitted with under-wing pylons and stronger wings which permitted them to carry two 1000-lb bombs, three 500-lb bombs or a combination of bombs and drop tanks. Either six or eight machine guns could be carried, and maximum ammunition capacity was 425 rpg. However with the full ordnance load, ammunition capacity was reduced to 267 rpg.\n \nP-47D-10 Thunderbolts enabled the pilot manually controlled the water flow of the injector.  When installed at the factory, the water-injected engines were designated R-2800-63. The R-2800-63 engine began to appear on the Farmingdale and Evansville production lines with blocks D-10. Water injection was automatic from the P47D-12 and on. Large Paddle blade props appeared from the P47D-22 series on. These paddle blade props gave significant increase in acceleration and climb performance.\n \nSome 199 or 200 P-47D-10  D-27s were sent to the Soviet Union under the Lend Lease program. After evaluation of the first aircraft  (P-47D-10 's) it was decided to use these aircraft in the high altitude antiaircraft defense role, particularly of big cities, like Moscow and Leningrad. The aircraft were also used by Baltic and Northern fleet naval aviation as recon and fast low level bombers, primarily due to their great range performance compared soviet aircraft.  In Soviet service the P47 saw limited combat action and then only in the Naval aviation service.\n\n Advantages:  The powerful, rugged, reliable R-2800 engine guaranteed great high altitude performance, and in combination with a hefty fuel load and sleek lines gave it outstanding range.  In combat, the Jugs fast dive speed allowed it to escape most enemies and the eight guns have it tremendous firepower without the need of cannons.  The P-47D was also a very durable aircraft and required a lot of firepower to bring down. At high altitudes it was one of the best fighters of the war.\n\nDisadvantages:  Particularly at lower altitudes, the Jug was not a good turn fighter.  It was best suited to boom and zoom tactics.  Additionally, the R2800 engine gave the Jug a sub-par climb rate.\n \n\n

However with the full ordnance load, ammunition capacity was reduced to 267 rpg.\n\nThe P-47D-22 batch was fitted with a "universal" wing that could carry a variety of drop tanks or bombs. These batches also introduced the R-2800-59 engine with an improved ignition system. The power was the same as that of the -63, with a war emergency power output of 2300 hp. The length of the tail wheel leg was increased.\nBeginning with production blocks D-22, a larger (13- foot diameter) paddle-bladed propeller was fitted to make full use of the additional power provided by water injection.\n\nD-25 blocks were also provided with a new jettison-able cockpit canopy, which was activated by the pilot pulling a ring. The hood would then be pushed backward, and the force of the slipstream would then do the rest of the job of pulling the canopy free of the aircraft. A bulletproof windshield was fitted, and internal fuel capacity was increased.\n\nSome 199 or 200 P-47D-10  D-27s were sent to the Soviet Union under the Lend Lease program.

The North American used two serial Mustang-Is to test out the idea. The prototypes were designated XP-51B. First test flight of a new prototype took place on November 30th of 1942.\nThe new engine mount prompted further modifications to the aircraft. The intercooler radiator was added to the radiator group under the fuselage. Radiator cowling was changed, and the radiator itself was modified. Also the airframe was strengthened, new ailerons were installed, and the plane received a new four-blade Hamilton Standard prop. \nAll this work paid off. The XP-51B was considerably superior to its predecessor in both the climb rate and top speed.\nSerial P-51Bs were powered by license-built V-1650-3 Merlin engines built by Packard. First serial P-51B flew on May 5th 1943. RAF designated the variant Mustang-III. British planes different from the American mainly in the shape of the canopy. British Mustang had a teardrop canopy in place of a visibility-hampering faired cockpit. As the canopy was produced by P. Malcolm & Co, the new canopy was known as the Malcolm Hood. Altogether the British received 274 P-51Bs. Some of them were used to intercept V-1s.\n\nMain Variants:\nP-51B-1-NA  Packard V-1650-3 Merlin Engine, 1400 HP on take-off. About 400 built\nP-51B-5-NA  Packard V-1650-3 Merlin Engine, 1400 HP on take-off. About 800 built.

Subsequent tests of P-51s powered by Rolls-Royce Merlin engines proved to drastically improve both speed and high altitude performance. USAAF P-51Bs with the Merlin engine were introduced into combat in December 1943, to escort B17s and B-24s on their missions over Germany.\nThe P-51D with its bubble-top canopy was perhaps the best-known version of the Mustang. It was also the most widely used variant of the Mustang, a grand total of 8,102 aircraft of this type being produced. \nOne of the shortcomings of the P-51B was its limited firepower of only four machine guns. In addition, the guns in each wing were aligned at rather odd angles, requiring a severe bend in the ammunition belt feeds and resulting in frequent gun jams. The P-51D gun installation was completely redesigned, and the result was the installation of three MG53-2 .50-caliber machine guns in each wing, all of them mounted upright and all fed by straight ammunition belts. The inboard guns each held 400 rounds, and the others 270 rounds each. \nP-51Ds had under wing hard points not only for bombs and fuel tanks but also for various types of air-to-ground rockets. These included zero-length stubs for six 5-inch rockets or as many as ten if no drop tanks were carried. Alternatively, "Bazooka" tubes could be carried in triple clusters. There were a few field conversions for special armament, examples including two drop tanks and six 100-lb bombs, four 100-lb bombs plus 36 fragmentation bombs, or four 75-Imp gallon drop tanks. Aircraft used in the China-Burma-India theater usually had a direction-finding loop antenna in front of the tailfin. \nThe P-51D began to arrive in Europe in quantity in March of 1944. The 55th Fighter Group was the first to get the P-51D, trading in its P-38s for the new bubble canopy fighters. The change from the torque-less twin-engine P-38 to the single engine P-51 caused some initial problems, and the lack of directional stability caused by the presence of a full fuselage tank took a lot of getting used to. However, once their pilots became fully adjusted to their new rides, they found that the P-51D gave them an edge in both speed and maneuverability over all Luftwaffe piston-engine fighters at altitudes above 20,000 feet. However Luftwaffe pilots considered the Mustang to be rather vulnerable to cannon fire, particularly the liquid-cooled Merlin engine, which could be put out of action by a single hit. \nThe Mustang was the only Allied fighter with sufficient range to accompany bombers on their "shuttle" missions in which landings were made in Russia after deep-penetration targets had been attacked from English bases. The Mustangs also participated in low-altitude strikes on Luftwaffe airfields, a rather dangerous undertaking as these fields were very heavily defended by flak. Heavy losses were suffered by American airmen in these raids due to Mustangs inability to withstand battle damage.\n\nAdvantages:  The long-range, high speed, high altitude performance of the P-51D made it an outstanding fighter for long-range bomber escort.\n\nDisadvantages:  While the high altitude performance was exceptional, the low-altitude was not as impressive.  The P-51D could be destroyed by damage that would not affect other aircraft so seriously.  This was due to the liquid-cooled engine that could be disabled by a single shot.\n\n\n

There were a few field conversions for special armament, examples including two drop tanks and six 100-lb bombs, four 100-lb bombs plus 36 fragmentation bombs, or four 75-Imp gallon drop tanks. Aircraft used in the China-Burma-India theater usually had a direction-finding loop antenna in front of the tailfin. \n\nThe P-51D began to arrive in Europe in quantity in March of 1944. The 55th Fighter Group was the first to get the P-51D, trading in its P-38s for the new bubble canopy fighters. The change from the torque-less twin-engine P-38 to the single engine P-51 caused some initial problems, and the lack of directional stability caused by the presence of a full fuselage tank took a lot of getting used to. However, once their pilots became fully adjusted to their new rides, they found that the P-51D gave them an edge in both speed and maneuverability over all Luftwaffe piston-engine fighters at altitudes above 20,000 feet. However Luftwaffe pilots considered the Mustang to be rather vulnerable to cannon fire, particularly the liquid-cooled Merlin engine, which could be put out of action by a single hit. \n\nThe Mustang was the only Allied fighter with sufficient range to accompany bombers on their "shuttle" missions in which landings were made in Russia after deep-penetration targets had been attacked from English bases. The Mustangs also participated in low-altitude strikes on Luftwaffe airfields, a rather dangerous undertaking as these fields were very heavily defended by flak. Heavy losses were suffered by American airmen in these raids due to Mustangs inability to withstand battle damage.\n\nThis MOD version is quite similar to the stock D-20NA, however it has additional load outs as mentioned above, adjusted flight model to correct some of the known handling and speed issues. Also included are armor Piercing Incendiary Tracer (AP-I-T) rounds.\n\n\nAdvantages:  The long-range, high speed, high altitude performance of the P-51D made it an outstanding fighter for long-range bomber escort.\n\nDisadvantages:  While the high altitude performance was exceptional, the low-altitude was not as impressive.  The P-51D could be destroyed by damage that would not affect other aircraft so seriously.  This was due to the liquid-cooled engine that could be disabled by a single shot.\n\n

Subsequent tests of P-51s powered by Rolls-Royce Merlin engines proved to drastically improve both speed and high altitude performance. USAAF P-51Bs with the Merlin engine were introduced into combat in December 1943, to escort B17s and B-24s on their missions over Germany.\nThe P-51D with its bubble-top canopy was perhaps the best-known version of the Mustang.

In addition, the guns in each wing were aligned at rather odd angles, requiring a severe bend in the ammunition belt feeds and resulting in frequent gun jams. The P-51D gun installation was completely redesigned, and the result was the installation of three MG53-2 .50-caliber machine guns in each wing, all of them mounted upright and all fed by straight ammunition belts.

P-63C             \n    P-63C-5 Kingcobra, 1944\n\nType: Multirole fighter\n\nWeight:\nTake-off: 3,995 kg\nMaximum: 4,858 kg\n\nLength: 9.96 m\nWingspan: 11.7 m\nWing area: 30.42 sq m\n\nEngine: 1 \u0425 Allison V-1710-117\nPower:\nSea level: 1,500 HP \nWith water injection: 1,800 HP\n\nTop speed:\nSea level: 590 km/h\nAt 7,625 m: 656 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 11,800 m\nRange: 4,120 km\n\nArmament:\n1 \u0425 37-mm M10 cannon\n2 \u0425 12,7-mm synchronized Colt-Browning MG 53-2 machine guns\n2 \u0425 12,7-mm Colt-Browning MG 53-2 machine guns in under wing gondolas\n\nP-63 Kingcobra was created as the result of various technical innovations created during the long life cycle of the P-39 Airacobra. The plane designers also paid close attention to feedback and requests from the Soviet side, as it was quite obvious the P-63 would be heavily used by the VVS which loved its predecessor so much. Both pilot feedback, as well as various recommendation from the Soviet TsAGI institute were used. TsAGI feedback was used both based on their evaluation of the P-39 as well as the initial P-63A variants, which suffered from several drawbacks expected of an initial prototype. \nOne of the most serious problems with the Bell fighter was its stability in cruise, and especially in maneuver. The Soviets recommended installation of an additional under-fuselage fin on the P-63A which rectified the problem. \nThe most significant difference between the P-36C-1 and the P-63A was the more powerful Allison V-1710-117 engine.  \nThe most mass produced version of the Kingcobra, the P-63C-5, also received better pilot protection, with overall weight of armor approaching 91 kg. Compared to the P-51D, the Kingcobra had somewhat better performance at low and medium altitudes where most of the Eastern Front air combat took place. Even at higher altitudes it was a decent fighter, as it had a higher top speed at 6,500-7,000 m than many contemporary Soviet planes.\nMost of the P-63s built were shipped to the Soviet Union, with 2,397 aircraft sent out which 21 were lost during transport. Around 300 were also sent to France, which used them in the Pacific theater.\nApproximately 200 P-63C-1s were modified into the RP-63C-2 Pinball gunnery target with heavy armor.\n\n\n\nMain Variants:\nP-63C-1  new Allison V-1710-117 engine, 211 built.\nRP-63C-2 Pinball - P-63C1 modified into a gunnery target. Approx. 200 built.\nP-63C-5  increased armor; 1,012 built.\n\nAdvantages:\nHigh top speed\nPowerful armament\nGood maneuverability\n\nDisadvantages:\nSlower climb rate than many contemporary planes\nStill somewhat spin and stall-prone\nLower fuel capacity than the P-39.\n\n\n

Initial work on the project then known as L-140 began in May of 1943 by Lockheed. As early as 24th of June an official contract was signed to develop the prototype fighter designated as XP-80. The project was headed by legendary Clarence Kelly Johnson who created such world-famous planes as the P-38 Lightning, U-2 and SR-71. For the P-80 he planned to use a licensed version of the British Haldford H.1B Goblin engine. \nXP-80 first took to the air on January 8th 1944 by Lockheeds test pilot Milo Burcham. The prototype had square wingtips and stabilizers, which were later replaced with more rounded ones. Work on the XP-80A began in late 1943; this variant was to be equipped with the General-Electric I-40/J-33-GE-9 engine. First XP-80A flew on June 10 1944. Serial version, the P-80A, was powered by both the J-33-GE from General-Electric as well as the Allison Division. Altogether 917 P-80As were produced. \nIn late 1944 a decision was made to send four YP-80A to Europe for combat testing. Two planes stayed in Great Britain, the other two being sent to Italy. Several combat missions were flown, but no enemy planes were ever encountered. IN the summer of 1945 two squadrons of the 412th FG were equipped with P-80As. They were intended to be used in the Pacific, but the Japanese surrendered before the squadrons were ready. So the real combat service for the P-80  did not start for another five years, until the Korean war.

The new plane was initially designated XP3Y-1, and competed against a XP3D-1 prototype build by Douglas. The XP3Y-1 first flew in October of 1935 and proved greatly superior to all flying boats in service with the US Navy at the time. \nThe plane was a novel design, created by a team lead by the brilliant Isaac Macklin London. For once, most of the wing was streamlined and it was virtually a cantilever. That made the wing free of interference drag caused by struts and wires on earlier designs.  The tail unit was also of a clean cantilever design, unlike earlier models. \nFirst PBYs entered squadron service in October of 1936, and by the time US entered WWII the PBY was a very common plane in US Navys inventory. During the previous years the PBY went through several modifications (PBY-1 through PBY-5). In these modifications the gun blisters were introduced which became such a characteristic feature of the airplane. The PBY-5 went into service in 1939-1940, and became the first PBY model accepted by the RAF. The British called the plane Catalina, and US Navy recognized that name in 1941.\nThe Catalina served in a multitude of roles. Its primary role was a patrol bomber, but it was also used as an anti-submarine aircraft, long-range reconnaissance, torpedo carrier, night bomber, air/sea rescue, transport/mail carrier and even a glider tug. The versatility was mostly due to Catalinas large cargo capacity  later modifications could take nearly 7,000 kg of cargo, almost twice its empty weight.\nBefore the war the Soviet Union as well showed interest in the PBY. It ordered three examples and invited Consolidated engineers to help set up a manufacturing plant for license-built PBYs. The Soviet version was equipped with Mikulin M-87 or M-88 engines and was designated GST. First GSTs rolled of the production lines in 1939. The Soviet Union also built another variant of the PBY designated MP-7 which was equipped with 850 hp M-62IR engines. \nAfter the war started, PBN-1 Nomads and later 48 PBY-6As were sent to Russia through the lend-lease program. It is interesting to note that a total of only 156 PBN-1s were built, 137 of which went to Russia.\nCatalinas were manufactured in many other countries, and the total number of all modifications is unknown. Close to 4,000 PBYs were built around the world.\n\nAdvantages:  Very versatile aircraft with a large carrying capacity. Did not need runways. Long range and reliable construction.\n\nDisadvantages:  Slow for its time. No self-sealing fuel tanks or crew armor.\n\n\n

M.\n\nEngine: 2xM-105R.\nPower: 1,100 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 454 km/h;\n    At 5,000m: 540 km/h.\n\nClimb to 5,000m: 8.5min. \nService ceiling: 8,800m.\nRange: 1,780 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.62mm (ShKAS);\n    2x12.7mm (BK);\n    Bombs of different weight on the inner and outside racks weighing up to 1,000 kg.\n\nThe Pe-2's creation started in late 1938 by a design group lead by V.M. Petlyakov (Pe). Initially the aircraft was designed in 1940 as a two-engine, high-altitude long-range fighter - project "100", because all military specialists predicted a considerable altitude increase for all military aircraft. At the end of 1939, the construction of the "PB-100" prototype was finished, and in December it successfully went through the flight trials. However, it would turn out that there were no practical applications for a fighter of this construction. At the same time, the Air Forces badly needed a fighting aircraft of a new type - a high-speed dive bomber. At first designers tried to combine the functions of the high-altitude fighter with those of the dive bomber, but in the end they gave up the idea and, in May 1940, they were required to remake the "100" into a dive bomber within a very limited time period. The new aircraft, which was later renamed the Pe-2, was tested in the autumn of 1940. Its mass production was launched as early as 1941.\n\nThe Pe-2 represented an all-metal shoulder-wing monoplane with two engines, and a two-fin tail. The aircraft had a pressurized cockpit. Its crew consisted of three men: pilot, navigator-bomber and gunner-radio operator. The Pe-2 was one of the first completely electrified aircraft. Flaps, air brakes, trimmers, ailerons, steer-able wheels, water radiator flaps, hydraulic system control and gear release were all performed with the help of electric motors of varying power. To alleviate diving and coming out of a dive after bomb dropping, a special automatic device was installed on the aircraft. The aircraft could carry up to 1,500 kg of bombs (in overload) of different weight. Thanks to excellent aerodynamics, the Pe-2 developed almost the same speed as the fighters of those years. The aircraft was widely used on the fronts of the Great Patriotic war from its first day. In the course of the war, the Pe-2 was constantly improved and modified.\n\nOverall, 11,070 units of the Pe-2 aircraft of all variations were produced from 1940 to 1945.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent flight performance. High speed and range. Fully electric controls. Simple and easily taught controls. \n\nDisadvantages: Weak on-board armament. Unreliable operation of some electric devices on the aircraft. \n

Petlyakov perished in a crash, further aircraft development was supervised by A.M. Izakson and later by A.I. Putilov. Defensive armament of the bomber was further enhanced. Beginning with the 83rd series, the navigators ShKAS machine gun was replaced with a large-caliber 12.7mm BT machine gun in a hatch mounting. These changes could be found earlier in different military units. A new standard mounting was also installed on aircraft of earlier output. For these purposes, special field modification sets were produced to be mounted on the front both by factory brigades, mechanics and arms specialists in the regiments. The M-105R engines were replaced with the more perfected M-105RA. Glazing of the front fuselage part was also reduced.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent firepower. Improved aircraft crew protection.\n\nDisadvantages: Diminished vision from the lower part of the front hemisphere. Increased weight of the aircraft. Lower maximum speed.\n

Toropov in June 1942. The turret represented an enclosed gun-ring with a UBT machine-gun (on some versions, a UBK machine-gun was mounted). At the same time, armor protection was increased and a new portable ShKAS machine-gun introduced. It could be thrown over from one side to another. The gunner could fire through small holes on the sides of the gunner-radio operator position. Glazing of the fuselage forepart was diminished. Electro, hydro and fuel systems were also modified.\n\nAdvantages: Strong armament. Improved armor protection of the aircraft. \n\nDisadvantages: Insufficient field of vision in the lower part of the front hemisphere. Increased weight of the aircraft. Lower speed indices.\n
Pe-2series359     \n    Pe-2, 1944 model (359th series)\n\nType: Dive Bomber\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 6,210 kg; \n    Take-off: 8,580 kg.\n\nLength: 12.66m.\nWingspan: 17.13m.\nWing area: 40.5 Sq.

Myasischev who later became a famous Soviet aircraft designer of strategic bombers. He took on the task of the Pe-2's modernization in the context of new front conditions. In this context, the M-105RA was replaced with a faster M-105PF with a take-off power of 1,210 HP. This step was forced to some extent. The M-105R was withdrawn from production to increase M-105PF output needed for fighters first and foremost. The engine stood out due to its optimization for low and medium flight altitudes. Thus after the installation of the new engines, maximum flight speed was also increased at altitudes of up to 4,000m; the speed dropped at higher altitudes. The Pe-2's overall altitude performance also deteriorated.\n\nA number of measures were taken to improve the aircraft's aerodynamics. Fairings were installed on the dive brakes, aircraft encapsulation was improved, the navigator turret modernized, the lower cap of the engine hood changed, new inlet ducts and individual exhaust ducts installed, the radio antenna mast was moved forward (on the canopy) and the gunner-radio operator's upper hatch changed.\n \nImprovements and modernization of Pe-2 aircraft were carried out up until the end of the Second World war. \n\nAdvantages: Strong armament. Improved aircraft aerodynamics. Excellent speed performance at altitudes of up to 4,000m.\n\nDisadvantages: Increased aircraft weight. Reduced range and service ceiling.\n
Pe-3series1       \n    Pe-3, 1941 model\n\nType: Heavy Interceptor/Bomber\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 5,730 kg; \n    Take-off: 7,860 kg.\n\nLength: 12.66m.\nWingspan: 17.13m.\nWing area: 40.5 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: 2xM-105RA.\nPower: 1,100 HP\n\nSpeed:\nSea level: 444 km/h;\nAt 5,000m: 535 km/h.\n\nClimb to 5,000m: 9.0min. \nService ceiling: 8,800m.\nRange: 2,150 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.62mm MG (ShKAS);\n    2x12.7mm MG (BK);\n    Bombs of different weight on the inner and outside racks weighing up to 1,000 kg.\n\nThe Pe-3 was developed in record time: just 4 days. It represented a fighter variant of the Pe-2 bomber. While creating the aircraft, the design team could employ the ideas used in the first Pe-2 design as a multipurpose aircraft. In connection with the aircraft's new purpose, special attention was given to increasing flight duration and range. To achieve the necessary range of 2,000km, additional fuel tanks had to be placed in all empty sections of the plane; for this purpose, it was even necessary to abandon the gunner-radio operator and take up his place with fuel tanks. As a result the aircraft crew was reduced to two men. In its interceptor variant, the aircraft wing was equipped with automatic leading edge slats. Air brake bars limiting diving speed were removed and offensive armament was strengthened by placing two 12.7mm caliber BK machine-guns in the front section of the aircraft. The bombing arrangements were considerably simplified. Acrylic transparent plastic on the low part of the fuselage nose was replaced with a duralumin panel, then a steel panel because the one made of acrylic plastic did not sustain the dual pressure of gun gases and fell to pieces (this outside feature distinguishes the Pe-3 from the Pe-2).\n\nA night variant of the Pe-3 was also developed; some came with 40cm under wing projectors or Gneis-2 radar sets. \n\nAircraft of this type were adopted by the Air Forces up until the end of the war and then used by Sea Aviation until the early fifties.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent long-range fighter-bomber. High range. Opportunity to be used as a barraging and night fighter-bomber. Simple and easily teachable controls. \n\nDisadvantages: No crew armor in the front. Insufficient armament. Weak radio station. Absence of radio compass. Unreliable operation of some electro mechanic devices on the aircraft.\n

Thus a decision was made in September 1941 to do some more work on the Pe-3 aircraft. As a result, an experimental, improved Pe-3bis aircraft appeared. It was tested at once in late September - early October. The aircraft differed from the basic plane in the following important areas: crew armor installation in the front; considerably improved armament - BK machine-guns in the front part of the fuselage were replaced with two large-caliber UBK machine-guns; the spot where the lower large-caliber machine-gun used to be placed was now taken up with a 20mm ShVAK gun. Turret mounting of the navigator ShKAS machine-gun was replaced with a portable mounting with a UBT machine-gun; to increase aircraft stability at low speed, the wings were equipped with automatic leading edge slats; all glasses in the cockpit had shutters preventing blinding of the crew in night flights.\n\nOverall, approximately 300 units of the Pe-3bis were produced.\n\nThe Pe-3bis was used very successfully near Moscow and on the other fronts as well as on sea scenarios for strafing ships.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent long-range fighter-bomber. Strong armament. Good crew armor. High range. Ability to use as barraging and night fighter-bomber. Simple and easily comprehensible controls. \n\nDisadvantages: Weak radio station. Absence of radio compass. Small field of vision in the front hemisphere. Complicated orientation. \n

MG (ShKAS);\n    2x20mm cannon (ShVAK);\n    Bombs of different weight on the inner and outside racks weighing up to 4,000 kg. (5,000 kg in overload)\n\nThe heavy, four-engine Pe-8 bomber (ANT-42, also TB-7) was designed in 1934 by the Design Office of V.M. Petlyakov led by A.N. Tupolev. The first unit was produced in autumn 1936 and, on December 27 of the same year, it underwent its first flight. The trials conducted revealed that at high altitudes, the Pe-8 excelled all known heavy bombers in terms of speed, and its flight performance corresponded to the best fighters of the time. However one of the bombers shortcomings was the initial installation of the AM-34FRN engine, which failed to provide sufficient power and altitude. For this reason, in 1940, the aircraft was equipped with the AM-35A engine and subsequently launched into large-scale production. In the course of this production, the aircraft's dimensions and construction were left practically unchanged except for the installation of different engine types. Some 98 aircraft units were produced.\n\nThe Pe-8 was used from the beginning to the end of World War II and exploited as a transport aircraft in the post-war years. It gained early fame in the Soviet Union when it participated in several bombing missions of Berlin in August of 1941, less than two months after Operation Barbarossa began on June 22, 1941\n\nAdvantages: Excellent long-range bomber. Good armament. High bomb load and range. Good crew armor. \n\nDisadvantages: Outdated, complicated fuselage and wing construction. Insufficient height. Outdated bombsights for bomb dropping (later used American, taken from damaged lend lease bombers).\n

Neman from the Kharkov aviation institute. The aircraft represented a monoplane with an air-cooled M-25 engine, which in the course of its mass production was replaced with a more powerful, high-altitude M-25V engine. For the most part, the plane had an all-wood construction except for its tail which was made of metal covered with fabric. The R-10 could be used as a reconnaissance aircraft, attack aircraft and light bomber. It could carry a bomb load of up to 300 kg in the fuselage bomb bay. In its reconnaissance variation, the R-10 had aero-cameras and wireless equipment for two-way radio communication. \n\nThe R-10 was mass produced from 1937 to 1940. Overall, some 530 units were produced.\n R-10 planes (also KhAI-5) were used aggressively until 1943, participated in battles over Moscow and Leningrad among other locations, and carried out reconnaissance operations together with Su-2 and Yak-4 aircraft.\n\nAdvantages: Multifunctionality. Good field of vision for the crew. Large coverage area for rear gunners turret.\n\nDisadvantages: Outdated aircraft construction. Weak armament. Complicated landing.\n

Junior 4-cylinder air-cooled inverted straight engine, 120 hp (90 kW)\n\n\nThe aircraft was designed as a single-seater aerobatic sports plane, that could also be used as a trainer for fighter aircraft pilots. The main designer was Jerzy Drzewiecki of the RWD construction team in the DWL (Doswiadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze) workshops. Its silhouette was similar to the RWD-8. The first prototype (registration SP-ALC), was flown in July 1933 by Drzewiecki. Its stability was not satisfactory, but after modifications, including lengthening a fuselage, it appeared a successful design and it completed state trials in 1935. In a mock dogfight with the PZL P.11c fighter, the RWD-10 kept on the P.11's tail. The first public aerobatics show of the RWD-10 took place during a Gordon Bennett Cup in ballooning in September 14-15, 1935 in Warsaw.\nIn 1936, a series of 20 aircraft was ordered by the LOPP paramilitary organization, funded by a public collection for aviation development. They were built in 1937 and then distributed among the Polish regional aero clubs - most (5) for Warsaw Aero Club. In 1938, another two were built. In total, approximately 22 serial RWD-10s were produced.\n\nThree aircraft were crashed before the war, the rest were probably destroyed during the Invasion of Poland in 1939.\n\nMixed construction single-engine single-seat braced high-wing (parasol wing) monoplane, conventional in layout.

SB_2M-100A        \n    Tupolev SB-2M-100, 1935 model\n\nType:  Bomber\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 4,060 kg  \n    Maximum: 5,628 kg\n\nLength:  12.24 m\nWingspan: 20.33 m\nWing area: 56.7 sq m\n\nEngine: 2 x Klimov M-100\nPower: 750 hp\n\nTop speed:\n    Sea level: 326 km/h\n    At 5,200 m: 393 km/h\nClimb rate to 5,000 m: 11.7 min\nService ceiling: 9,000 m    \nRange: 2,187 km\n\nArmament:\n    4 x 7.62 mm ShKAS MG\n    600 kg of bombs\n\nThe development of the SB started in 1933 when the Tupolev design bureau began to design a modern high-speed bomber. A.A. Arkhangelsky was the chief designer on the project. The plane was an all-metal two engine monoplane with retractable landing gear and an enclosed cockpit. The main design goal was reaching the highest possible speed. A new wing profile was specifically designed for this plane, which had a somewhat low lift but provided for very little drag. The plane went through an unprecedented for the time amount of wind tunnel tests. It was powered by two license-built Hispano-Suiza 12Y engines, renamed M-100 in USSR.\n\nBy early 1935 the plane entered serial production. It would see combat in only a year.\n\nIn the fall of 1936 the SB was sent with the Soviet volunteer force to assist the Spanish Republican government in their civil war. The plane was clearly superior in construction and flight characteristics to any other bombers that served in the conflict: Ju-52, Ju-86, SM-81, etc. During the first stage of the war SBs piloted by Soviet and Spanish crews did not even need fighter escort  enemy opposition simply could not catch up with them. SBs were very effective against a wide range of targets, including infantry positions, airfields, marshalling yards, seaports, and ships. There had been cases of SB regiments intercepting and scattering enemy bombers formations. However, the SBs air superiority became much less evident after better anti-aircraft guns were received by the Nationalists, and finally almost negated with the introduction of the powerful new Bf-109B fighter.\n\nThe SB was also used in 1937 against Japan in China and Khalkin Gol. Several shortcomings were uncovered during the combat engagements in Spain and China, mainly in the area of vulnerability and defensive fire coverage. However, the Soviet industry did not have time to improve on the SBs design in time. When Germany invaded Russia in the summer of 1941, most SBs still had unprotected fuel tanks which easily caught fire and old-style gunner positions with very restrictive coverage and limited visibility. German fighter pilots, well familiar with the SB since encounters in Spain, found them an easy target. Soviet crews who were generally poorly trained compared with their German counterparts found that their plane could not outmaneuver or outspeed the German Bf-109E and its large unprotected fuel tanks caught fire easily. Since the SBs usually operated without fighter escorts during that period, the losses were staggering. By 1942 the type was largely withdrawn from front-line service.\n\nAdvantages:  Very fast bomber when initially designed, SB outpaces most fighters during the Spanish Civil War.  It was easy to control, had very forgiving flight characteristics and had a very short take-off run of only 300 meters.\n\nDisadvantages:  The plane was hopelessly obsolete by 1941. It was too vulnerable and its bomb load was too light to have any serious impact on the rolling German panzers.\n\n
SB_2M-103         \n     Tupolev SB-bis (SB-2M-103), 1938 model\n\nType:  Bomber\n\nWeight:\n    Empty:  4,427 kg  \n    Maximum:  7,750 kg\n\nLength: 12.27 m\nWingspan: 20.33 m\nWing area: 56.7 sq m\n\nEngine: 2 x Klimov M-103\nPower: 960 hp\n\nTop speed:\n    Sea level: 358 km/h\n    At 5,200 m: 419 km/h\nClimb rate to 5,000 m:  8.4 min\nService ceiling:  9,600 m    \nRange:  1,800 km\n\nArmament:\n    4 x 7.62 mm ShKAS MG\n    600 kg of bombs in bomb bay\n    1,000 kg of bombs on external bomb racks\n\nThe SB-2M-103 also known as SB-bis was the last-ditch attempt to bring the obsolete design up to modern standards. The new M-103 engines had a good effect on performance, significantly increasing top speed and climb characteristics. The plane could now maintain a speed of 250 km/h at 2,000 meters on only one engine.\n\nThe fully enclosed gunner positions with clunky retractable turrets were replaced with the modern MV-3 and MV-2 turrets which provided for a much better defensive fire coverage. External hard points were installed which allowed up to 1,000 kg of bombs to be carried under the wings. However, the variant did not enter large-scale production until 1940, and SB-bis did not enter the wars with Finland and Germany in any kind of considerable quantity.\n\nThe SB-bis still suffered from the same problems as its predecessor the SB. It was still too slow to be used without fighter escort, as was often the case in the first months of the war. It was still very vulnerable to enemy fire, and the type was withdrawn from front-line service with all the SB variants soon after the German invasion.\n\nAdvantages:  Considerable bomb load, easy to control. Good defensive field of fire.\n\nDisadvantages:  Still obsolete by 1941 standards. SB-bis was very vulnerable to German flak guns and 20mm cannon of the Bf-109E.\n\n\n
SBD-3             \n    Douglas SBD Dauntless\n\nType: Carrier-borne dive bomber and reconnaissance.\n\nWeight:\nEmpty: 3,030 kg (6,680 lbs)\nTakeoff, Typical: 3,150 kg (6,950 lbs)\nTakeoff, Fully Loaded: 4,950 kg (10,900 lbs)\n\nWingspan: 12.66 m (41.5 ft)\nLength: 10.09 m (33 ft)\nHeight: 4.14 m (13.6 ft)\n\nEngine: 1x Wright R-1820-66\nPower: 1,350 hp\n\nSpeed:\nAt 4500m (14,760 ft): 413 km/h (256.5 mph)\n\nClimb to 4500 m (14,760 ft): 9 min. 22 sec\nService Ceiling: 7,800 m (25,584 ft)\nRange: 2,525 km (1,570 miles)\n\nArmament:\n2x.50 cal MG;\n2x.30 cal MG rear cockpit;\nBombs: 1x1,600 lb or 2x147 kg.\nExternal Fuel: 2x220 L.\n\nWhen the Dauntless entered the service with US Navy in 1939, it was already an obsolete aircraft. It was slow, poorly armed and its maneuverability was nothing to write home about. Nevertheless it was the standard Navy dive-bomber until November 1943, when it was replaced by Curtiss SB2C Helldivers.\nDesigned as light dive-bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, it also served with US Marine Corps and the Army. Dauntless came under the spotlight on 4 June, during the battle for tiny Pacific island of Midway. By stroke of luck a patrolling PBY spotted the Japanese fleet, led by aircraft carriers: Kaga, Akagi, Soryu and Hiryu. 108 US carrier aircraft were then launched and sent in direction of the enemy fleet. \nUnseen by the enemy, a flight of SBDs from Enterprise dove from the clouds, buzzing through the pool of US and Japanese airplanes. 2,000 lb bombs hit one by one the jewels of Japanese Navy  Kaga, Akagi, Soryu and Hiryu. With decks crowded with airplanes, torpedoes, fuel and bombs, they were easy targets. Suddenly many Zeros were caught in the air, with nowhere to land. Job was finished by Yorktowns SBDs, sinking the Hiryu next day.\nSBDs showed their teeth again in Guadalcanal Campaign, operating both from Henderson Field and from aircraft carriers. They have sunk many enemy ships, among others the carrier Ryujo in the battle for Eastern Solomons. In November 1942 they attacked and sunk the cruiser Kinugasa. \nWhen Curtiss Helldiver entered the service and was put in action alongside SBD Dauntless, it became apparent that SBD were superior to newcomers. But Helldivers were already in mass-production, and SBDs were slowly taken out of the service in 1944. In June 1944 SBDs saw one of the last large-scale battles in the Battle for Philippine Sea.\n\n\nManufacturer:\nDouglas Aircraft Company, United States of America\n\nMain Modifications:\nSBD-3  self-sealing tanks installed, better armour, armed with 2x .50 cal + 2x .30 cal MG. 585 built.\nSBD-4  New propeller and current changed (from 12V to 24V). 780 built.\nSBD-5  More powerful engine (1,200 hp Wright R-1820-60). 2970 built.

First Seafires (official name was Sea Spitfire) were just quick adaptations of land-based Spitfires, just the arrestor hook and catapult spools for use on carriers were added and were given a name Seafire Ib. On February 10th 1942 first Seafires landed on Aircraft carrier Illustrious. Shortly after first more specialized versions emerged  Seafire IIc already had strengthened landing gear and a new engine  Merlin 32 with four blade propeller. Next version was already fully prepared for sea-borne operations  Seafire III featured double folding wing and better engine  1,585 hp Merlin 55. \nSpitfire has gained quite a reputation of being remarkably agile, however when it first encountered the Zero in skirmishes over Darwin, Spitfire pilots discovered in shock that the Zero could easily out-turn them. In operations in defending Australia another shortcoming came to light  relatively small range. On top of that, Spitfires narrow distance between the wheels contributed too many landing mishaps. But there were good news  Spitfire was well armed and the pilot more than adequately protected.\nSeafire III was mostly used in Indian Ocean with the Far Eastern Fleet and in the Pacific with the British Pacific Fleet.\n\n\nManufacturer:\nSupermarine Aviation Works (Vickers) Ltd, United Kingdom.\n\nMain Modifications:\nMk I  Armed with 8x .30 cal MG, later 2x 20mm gun and 4x .30 cal MG. 1500 built.\nMk V - New Merlin engine. 6500 built.\nMk VIII  Mostly sent overseas. By some features one of the best variants. Filters were incorporated into air intake, Vokes filters, reducing the performance of the engine were now gone. Different engines were fitted  Merlin 70, Merlin 60/63 and 66. 1686 built.\nMk IX  the most famous version, built to bring Spitfire V on par with FW-190. Spitfire Mk VIII had been ordered, but it couldn't be delivered in required quantities. So Merlin 60 engine was fitted on Mk Vc airframe, bringing the performance very close to its adversary. Four 7.62mm MG were replaced by two 12.7mm machine guns, the 20 mm guns were retained. Later versions equipped with Griffon engine, were largely used for low-level attack missions, often the wings were clipped. 5609 built.\n\nAdvantages:\nExcellent maneuverability. Well-armed. \n\nDisadvantages:\nPoor ground handling, with inadequate visibility while taxiing. Low range.\n\n\n\n
SpitfireMkVb      \n    Spitfire Mk.V series\n\nType: fighter\n\nWeight, loaded: 2960 kg\n\nLength:        9.12 meters\nWingspan: 11.23 meters\nWing area: 21.78 m2\n\nEngine:  Rolls Royce Merlin 45/46\nPower:   Take Off  1185 HP\nMaximum  1515 at 3350 meters at +16 lbs boost\n\nSpeed:  371 mph at 6100 meters\nClimb:    8 mins 24 secs to 6100 meters\nCeiling:  11,430 meters\n\nArmament: \n2 x 20mm Hispano Cannon, 60 rpg\n4 x .303 Browning machineguns, 350 rpg\n\nThe Spitfire Mk V grew out of the realization that the Mk I and Mk II Spitfire of the Battle of Britain were no longer capable of meeting the newer German aircraft on equal terms. In particular, concern arose regarding a feared German high altitude reconnaissance and bombing capability that in reality never fully materialized.\n\nThe Mk V utilized the Rolls-Royce Merlin 45 engine to give it improved speed and high altitude performance. Initially it was Britains most capable fighter, on a par with the Bf-109F models fielded by the enemy. However as the Focke-Wulf Fw-109A-3 and the Spitfire Mk IX appeared, the deficiencies of the Mk V (poor climb and top speed) became apparent. Thereafter the Mk V was to be heavily modified, with three different wing shapes and 10 different engine types to fit the aircraft to new roles. In particular this meant smaller superchargers and clipped wings to improve low altitude performance, where the tight horizontal turn of the Mk V could best be used. These low altitude variants were known as LF Mk Vs.\n\nThe first Mk Vs were initially conversions of the Battle of Britain Spitfires  the Mk VA retained the original 8 .303 machineguns, while the Mk VBs were conversions of the newer cannon armed fighter, with twin Hispano 20mm cannon and four machineguns, a configuration that was retained for the new-build Mk VCs. The improved armament finally gave British fighters a good fighter weapon against the newer, more armored German planes.\n\nThe first Mk Vs were introduced into service in mid-February 1941 by No.92 Sqn in Manston, Kent, being conversion of Spitfire IBs. Throughout the Spring, other south-coast fighter squadrons sent their Spitfires for conversion, mirroring the introduction of the Bf-109F-2 across the Channel.\n\nThe Friedrich had similar top speeds at altitude and a similar ceiling, but was better at low altitude, being 40 km/h faster and with a better rate of climb. The Spitfire was much better armed though and most fighting took place at medium to high altitudes.\n\nDuring these early months a number of deficiencies were found and corrected  a larger oil cooler air intake prevented over-heating, a new Rotol Constant Speed Propellor system prevented it freezing up at high altitude, metal ailerons allowed faster rolls at high speed and the Schilling modification allowed negative G maneuvers. The Spitfire Mk V was turning into a very effective aircraft.\n\nThe major combat use of the Mk V from British shores was in Circus operations: a few bombers would be sent against a target in France or Belgium with heavy fighter escort in the hope of getting the Luftwaffe to come up and play. Although extended operations above hostile territory was a major risk, it was felt that the effects of inactivity of RAF morale would be far worse. The imperative to be seen to be doing something grew after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, when Churchill had to be able to assure the Russians that he was doing everything he could to tie down German air resources in the West.\n\nIn the late Summer of 1941, the Fw-190 arrived on the Channel Front. It was faster than the Mk V and could out climb and out roll it at all altitudes. The Spitfires single advantage was in a tight turn, where it could easily beat a Focke-Wulf. The 190 was a very dangerous opponent and only their low numbers and engine problems kept them from inflicting heavy damage to the RAF in 1941.\n\n1942 was a bad year for the Spitfire Mk V: with 6 Gruppen of Fw-190 (JG 2 and JG 26) ranged against them the RAF lost planes and pilots over the Channel and France in increasing numbers. The RAF were unable to prevent the passage of the German Navy through the Channel in February, summer Circus raids often resulted in heavy casualties without a single Fw-190 being shot down and 53 Mk V Spitfires were lost during a single day during Operation Jubilee in August.\n\nThe introduction of the Mk IX Spitfire with the new Merlin 61 engine in July 1942 meant that the Mk V could concentrate on medium and lower altitudes, with the Mk IX flying top cover. The Mk IX did not replace the Mk V for a long time though  a big 36 squadron operation in September 1943 still contained 18 Mk V squadrons. Still, it was clear that the Mk V was no longer top dog. The remaining squadrons gradually replaced their engines with new low altitude variants, several squadrons retaining the Mk V until well after D-Day. These low altitude Spitfire LF Vs were as fast as a Fw-190 at 6000 feet and faster than a Messerschmitt Bf-109G.\n\nThe Circus, Ramroad and Rodeo operations of 1941-1943 had proved costly, but the RAF held the initiative, allowing them to choose the time and place of the battle and achieve local numerical superiority. The same would not be true abroad.\n\nThe Spitfire Mk V was the first Spitfire to see extensive service outside the United Kingdom. It served with RAF/Commonwealth forces in Malta, North Africa, Italy, New Guinea, Australia, Burma and elsewhere, as well as equipping several US squadrons in the UK and Tunisia. \n\nIn March 1943 143 Spitfire Mk Vs were sent to Basra in Iraq where they were assembled and flown to the Soviet Union, serving in the Moscow PVO (Air Defence) and in fighter divisions in the Kuban theatre.\n\n
TB-3_4M-17        \n    Tupolev TB-3-4M-17 (17F) 1932 model\n\nType: Heavy Bomber\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 10,967 kg\n    Take-off: 17,200 kg\n\nLength: 24.4 m \nWingspan: 39.5 m\nWing area: 230.0 sq. m\n\nEngine: 4xM-17F\nPower:\n    Indicated: 500 hp\n    Take-off: 730 hp\n\nTop speed:\n    Sea level: 197 km/h\n    At 3000 m: 177 km/h\nService ceiling: 3,800 m\nRange: 1,350 km\n\nArmament:\n    2,000 kg of bombs; \n    6 x 7.62 mm  MG (DA)\n\nBy the late 1920s aviation designers in many countries simultaneously began development of multi-engine heavy bombers. The Tupolev design bureau in the Soviet Union achieved some of the notable successes. They had a good base design in the two-engine all metal TB-1 (ANT-4) heavy bomber and the R-6 (ANT-7) reconnaissance plane. Andrey Tupolev began designing aircraft with the base weight of 20, 30 and 40 metric tons. The first plane of his new heavy series was the TB-3 (ANT-6). \nIn February of 1929 VVS Headquarters and TsAGI signed an order for a All-metal plane of a bomb carrying type with 2,400 hp engines. Different TsAGI designers received different parts of the project. V.M. Petlyakov worked on the wing, N.S. Nekrasov on the empennage, A.I. Putilov on the landing gear, A.A. Arkhangelsky on the fuselage and controls and E. I. Potosky on the engines and overall planning. \nThe first example was delivered and assembled directly at the Frunze airfield on October 31st of 1930. Some defects were immediately uncovered and first flight was delayed by almost a month. On December 22nd of  1930 flight crew led by M.M. Gromov made the first flight. It almost ended in a catastrophe. The problem was with the mounting of the throttle controls for the license-built Curtiss V-1570 Conqueror engines. Due to vibration during take-off the engines uncontrollably switched to idle power. Gromov was barely able to hold the plane in the air by pulling on the controls with both hands. Immediately after take-off he initiated a sharp low-level turn over the Central airfields hangars. Only due to the crews skill was it possible to save the plane. The throttles were reset and during the later flights the mechanic had to constantly hold them down with his hands. Later modifications were made to keep the engine controls in place.\nThe ANT-6 received the following evaluation after the flight-testing was over: The planes performance is quite competitive with all foreign heavy bombers. The ANT-6 was ordered into production with M-17 engines (license built BMW-VI). The plane fitted with new engines entered flight tests in April of 1931. Testing had to stop in August due to problems with the imported Polmer tires. By January of 1932 Soviet-made twin 1350x350 gear was installed. In addition to that gunner turrets were installed under each wing; vertical stabilizer was enlarged; additional bomb racks were installed under the wings and fuselage; and various changes were made to the radio and electric equipment. Finally the production prototype was finalized. State trials began on October 10, 1932 and were successfully completed without any problems. Production started on Factories N 22 and 39. Factory N38 would produce the empennage for the planes. \nFirst series of nine aircraft rolled off the production line in April of 1932 and went straight to participate in the May 1st parade in Moscow. The planes were rushed through production and therefore had many flaws. They entered service much later while their many problems had to be worked out. \nTB-3 entered large scale serial production very quickly. By 1933 each factory was producing several planes a day. Such production figures required good organization, quick familiarization with new technology and most importantly forming a large group of qualified engineers. All that became a great foundation for producing better quality planes in the future.\nOverall the TB-3 marked the beginning of the heavy bomber force (DBA) for the VVS. TB-3s participated in many large-scale training exercises as bombers and transports. In 1935 war games near Kiev TB-3s airlifted 3,700 paratroops with heavy equipment.\nOverall, 818 TB-3s were produced during the five year production run. Over a half of them were the TB-3-4M-17 (17F) model.\n\n\n

Douglas TBD-1 Devastator became operational in 1937, but it was already obsolete due to its short range and lack of speed. Two years later the Bureau of Aeronautics issued new design specifications for carrier-based torpedo bomber. \nOn December 23rd, 1941, just few weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, Grumman received an order for 286 TBF-1 torpedo bombers. The attack on Hawaiian islands was also responsible for its nickname  Avenger.\n\nAvenger was the first bomber equipped with electrical powered rear gun turret. Although armed only with one MG, it was a .50-cal which was quite effective against Japanese fighters. \nThe new torpedo bomber drew first blood at the Battle of Midway. The debut turned out to be disaster. On June 4, six TBF-1s together with 27other dive bombers and four B-26s attacked a Japanese convoy, but suffered extremely high losses. Only one Avenger managed to return to base. But the loss was not in vain  the attack disrupted Japanese schedule, and almost all fighters were on flight decks, when three squadrons of Dauntless dive bombers arrived at the scene and five Japanese aircraft carriers were sent to the bottom. \n\nThe production ever increased, and from Guadalcanal landings in 1942 onward, the Avenger was the only ship-borne torpedo bomber in use. Grumman was also under pressure  US Navy demanded more and more Hellcat fighters, so Grumman had to move the Avenger production line elsewhere, Eastern Aircraft Division of General Motors to be precise. GM built TBF-1 was renamed to TBM.\n\nThe Avenger's virtues, especially its ruggedness, reliability, and stability as a weapons platform, ensured it a remarkably long operational history.

Douglas TBD-1 Devastator became operational in 1937, but it was already obsolete due to its short range and lack of speed. Two years later the Bureau of Aeronautics issued new design specifications for carrier-based torpedo bomber. \nOn December 23rd, 1941, just few weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, Grumman received an order for 286 TBF-1 torpedo bombers. The attack on Hawaiian islands was also responsible for its nickname  Avenger.\n\nAvenger was the first bomber equipped with electrical powered rear gun turret. Although armed only with one MG, it was a .50-cal which was quite effective against Japanese fighters. \nThe new torpedo bomber drew first blood at the Battle of Midway. The debut turned out to be disaster. On June 4, six TBF-1s together with 27other dive bombers and four B-26s attacked a Japanese convoy, but suffered extremely high losses. Only one Avenger managed to return to base. But the loss was not in vain  the attack disrupted Japanese schedule, and almost all fighters were on flight decks, when three squadrons of Dauntless dive bombers arrived at the scene and five Japanese aircraft carriers were sent to the bottom. \n\nThe production ever increased, and from Guadalcanal landings in 1942 onward, the Avenger was the only ship-borne torpedo bomber in use. Grumman was also under pressure  US Navy demanded more and more Hellcat fighters, so Grumman had to move the Avenger production line elsewhere, Eastern Aircraft Division of General Motors to be precise. GM built TBF-1 was renamed to TBM.\n\nThe Avenger's virtues, especially its ruggedness, reliability, and stability as a weapons platform, ensured it a remarkably long operational history. It in fact remained in service - as an anti-submarine and airborne early-warning aircraft - until 1954. \n\n\nManufacturer:\nGrumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation , Eastern Aircraft Division of General Motors, United States of America\n\nMain Modifications:\nTBF-1  First operational model. 1530 built.\nTBF-1C\t- armed with 2x forward firing .50 cal MG, longer range, 770 built\nTBM-1  Identical to TBF-1, just build under licence by Eastern Aircraft division of General Motors.\nTBM-1C  Identical to TBF-1C. 2332 built.\nTBM-3  Weight was increased, new engine installed - Wright R-2600-20 Cyclone rated at 1,900 hp, Norden bombsight removed in favor of auto-pilot. 4657 built.\n\nAdvantages:\nStructurally strong.\n\nDisadvantages:\nSlow, not maneuverable.\n\n\n

This plane was in development from March 1 of 1940. As early as January 8, 1941, the first prototype was built and on January 29, this plane had its first flight. The Tu-2 prototype was in trials up until June 1941. With the onset of the war, the Tupolevs design bureau's manufacturing was moved to the city of Omsk and only in July of 1942 did the first limited large-scale production get underway. All of these first planes were sent to a special regiment for troops trials on Kalinins front. With the urgent needs for new Yak-9 fighters, the production of the Tu-2 was stopped until September 1943, when large-scale production of the aircraft was again launched. In 1944, Tu-2s became widely used as level and dive bombers.\n\nTu-2 was in production until 1952 and was the best Soviet bomber of WWII. \n\nAdvantages: Excellent flight performance. Simple and easy controls. Good maneuverability. Excellent crew armor and gunnery protection of fighter attacks. \n\nDisadvantages: Small life space for gunners. \n
U-2VS             \n    U-2VS (LNB) \n\nType: Light Bomber/Liaison/Reconnaissance\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 773 kg; \n    Take-off: 1,400 kg.\n\nLength: 8.10m.\nWingspan: 11.40m.\nWing area: 33.1 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: M-11D.\nPower: 115 HP\n\nMax. speed: 134 km/h.\n\nClimb to 1,500m: 4.8min. \nService ceiling: 1,500m.\nRange: 450 km.\n\nArmament:\n    1x7.62mm MG (ShKAS) or 1x7.62mm MG (DA).\n\nThe U-2 (U for "uchebny" - trainer) later renamed the Po-2 ("Polikarpov two") was created by designer N.N. Polikarpov in 1928 as an aircraft for initial training, however, thanks to its design and construction, it was used in various fields ranging from agriculture to front-line aviation. The U-2 gave a very good showing during the test held on January 7, 1928. The trials demonstrated that the aircraft had great longitudinal stability. At a high angle of attack and in case of a possible stall, the aircraft lowered its nose and picked up speed again, it flew up at top speed, lowered the nose and reduced its altitude at a low engine revolution rate. The aircraft did not snap into a spin and if it did so purposely, it came out of it with the control stick in neutral position. The aircraft even allowed the pilot to drop the controls for a short while. All these aircraft performance peculiarities were so unique that it was immediately launched into serial production. \n\nDuring the Second World war, the U-2 was entrusted with a new purpose unheard of for a light aircraft used for initial training. The U-2 was modernized into a light, night bomber (LNB for Legkhii Nochnoi Bombardirovshik - Light Night Bomber) under the direction of designers N.N. Polikarpov and G.I. Bakshaev. The bomb load reached 350 kg, enabled due to unique U-2 features related to its ability to carry a heavy load without a long take-off run and without the risk of the airframe disintegrating in mid-air. After additional modernizations, the aircraft was baptized the U-2VS (Voyenny Samolet, or military aircraft) and was launched into large-scale production in 1942.\n\nThe U-2VS's designated tasks were bombing operations at low altitude conducted for the most part at night, with the purpose to undermine enemy troops' morale, destroy enemy airplanes on the ground as well as fuel deposits, ammunition and supply warehouses. At the same time it was possible to simultaneously conduct reconnaissance operations, provide for communication between military units, etc. The U-2VS was also successfully run by the Soviet women regiments, known as the Night Witches.\n\n32,711 U-2 airplanes were produced during the pre-war and war years.\n\nAdvantages: The best night bomber in its class during the Second World war. Excellent flight performance. Easy and simple controls. Reliability. Durability. Simple maintenance and multi functionality.\n

It became the base model for further Yak-1 types and modifications. The Yak-1 was produced in various versions, including a winter model with ski gear; rockets and bombing armament; a lightweight version; improved aerodynamics; improved vision, armor and armament; equipped with devices for night flights in air-defense systems, etc. It should be noted that each further Yak version was better than the previous one.\nThe mass production of Yak-1 had begun in May 1940. In the winter 1940-41 the troops began to receive new Yak-1 fighters. \n\nAdvantages: Excellent flight performance for 1940. High maneuverability and good armament. Easy to control and master, even for pilots who were not highly qualified, which was essential in wartime conditions.\n\nDisadvantages: Defects and imperfections that cropped up in the course of large-scale production (at the beginning of production these defects had to be eliminated with the participation, and under management, of Yakovlev's design bureau before August of 1941)\n\n\n
Yak-1B            \n    Yak-1B\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 2,316 kg\n    Take-off: 2,884 kg\n\nLength: 8.48m\n    Wingspan: 10.0m\n    Wing area: 17.15 Sq.

It became the base model for further Yak-1 types and modifications. The Yak-1 was produced in various versions, including a winter model with ski gear; rockets and bombing armament; a lightweight version; improved aerodynamics; improved vision, armor and armament; equipped with devices for night flights in air-defense systems, etc. It should be noted that each further Yak version was better than the previous one.\n\nThe Yak-1B (this unofficial name was given to this version by the troops) was a front-line fighter and represented a modified version of the standard Yak-1 with improved armor and armament, not to mention a redesigned canopy which gave a better rear view. The aircraft's aerodynamics were considerably improved. Instead of two 7.62mm caliber ShKAS machine-guns, one 12.7mm UBS synchronized machine-gun was installed. The replacement of the Yak-1's standard M-105PA engine by a more powerful M-105PF engine was also of great importance, although the new engine was not operable at equally high altitudes. Mounting a new engine considerably enhanced the aircraft's flight performance, thus ending the German Bf-109F-4's superiority in speed at medium and low altitudes. \n\nLarge-scale production of the Yak-1B started in September 1942. Overall, 4,188 units of this version were built. In total, 8,734 Yak-1 units were produced, all versions included.\n\nThe Yak-1 became one of the most widespread Soviet fighters; it was used by one third of all fighting regiments of the Soviet Air Forces. The Yak-1 took part in military operations until the end of the Second World war. It proved itself as an excellent fighter at low and medium altitudes and displayed its ability to outdo any opponent in terms of maneuverability thanks to its high stability in all flight conditions and excellent responsiveness at large angles of attack.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent serial front-line fighter. Excellent flight performance. Good vision from the pilot's cockpit. Made night flights possible without special equipment. High maneuverability and strong armament. Easy to control and master, even for pilots not highly qualified, which was essential in wartime conditions.\n\nDisadvantages: Defects and imperfections that cropped up in the course of large-scale production (at the beginning of production, these defects had to be eliminated with the participation, and under management, of Yakovlev's design bureau).\n
Yak-3             \n    Yak-3 \n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 2,123 kg; \n    Take-off: 2,692 kg.\n\nLength: 8.50 m\nWingspan: 9.20 m\nWing area: 14.85 Sq.

Developed with experience of the war years, the fighter represented a new type of aircraft. It incorporated all the best there was on the Yak-1 and Yak-9 planes, and additionally featured a number of innovations that were tested for the first time and later used on all Yak-9 modified versions. The Yak-3 with the VK-105PF2 engine was the lightest and the most maneuverable aircraft not only in the Yak family, but among all planes of the countries at war.\n\nApart from the Yak-3 serial version equipped with a VK-105PF2 engine (1,240 HP), the production of a Yak-3 with a more powerful VK-107A engine (1,500 HP, speed 611 km/h at sea level and 720 km/h at 5,750m) was launched. The VK-105PF2 Yak-3 was second to the VK-107A Yak-3 by its flight performance, but surpassed the later in the perfection of its power plant, which made it more battle-worthy and reliable in terms of maintenance. The VK-105PF2 Yak-3 had several armament variants: 1 x 12.7 mm MG (UBS) + 1 x 20 mm cannon (ShVAK); 2 x 12.7 mm MG (UBS) + 1 x 20 mm cannon (ShVAK); 2 x 20 mm cannon (ShVAK).\n\nThe Yak-3 had a much better combat performance than the last Bf-109G and FW-190A German piston-engined fighters and those shipped to the USSR under the lend-lease program. The Yak-3's superiority over the Bf-109 and the FW-190 in speed, rate of climb and maneuverability at altitudes up to 5,000m - where air battles usually took place - were so overpowering that the German pilots preferred to avoid taking on the Yak-3.\n\nOn the front, the Yak-3 was praised far and wide and was considered the best fighter of its time. French pilots of the Normandy-Nieman regiment chose the Yak-3 out of all available Soviet, English and American fighters offered to them and conducted a number of extremely successful operations with it. \n\nOverall, 4,797 Yak-3 units with the VK-105PF2 engine were produced up until the end of the war.\n\nAdvantages: One of the best mass-produced front-line fighters of the end of the Second World war, featuring a high flight performance. Improved aerodynamics. High maneuverability and strong armament. Absolute superiority in terms of combat features over the latest German, English and American piston-engined planes at altitudes of up to 5,000-6,000m. Higher aircraft durability. Simple and easily teachable controls.\n\nDisadvantages: The first mass-produced aircraft displayed essential factory defects related to losses of upper sheeting from the wing frame when diving at maximum speed. On account of its limited fuel supply, it was impossible to use the aircraft for bomber escort.\n
Yak-3VK-107       \n    Yak-3 VK-107A, 1945\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight:\n Empty: 2,346 kg\n Take-off: 2,984 kg\n\nLength: 8.55 m\nWingspan: 9.2 m\nWing area: 14.85 sq m\n\nEngine: 1 x VK-107A\nPower: 1,500 at sea level\n\nTop speed:\n Sea level: 611 km/h\n At 5,750 m: 720 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 11,800 m\nRange: 1,060 km\nClimb rate: 1,282 m/min\n\nArmament:\n 2 x 20mm B-20S cannon (120 shells each)\n\nWhen the new 1,650 HP VK-107A piston engine became available in late 1943, it was tried on several existing aircraft, including the Yak-3. The first two prototypes were completed on January 6, 1944, and entered flight testing in April of that year. Design changes included brand new 20mm B-20 cannon, cockpit moved back by 40 cm, slightly redesigned landing gear, and other engine-specific changes.\n\nThe flight tests went well, with the aircraft exhibiting excellent performance. The final test report named the prototype the overall best of any Soviet or foreign fighters. While its weight grew compared to other Yak-3s, its power-to-weight ratio was still considerably better than of its German counterparts: only 2.0 kg/HP. \n\nWhile the first prototypes used mixed construction, the subsequent versions used all-metal construction. The metal wing exhibited excellent performance, and outperformed all aircraft except Spitfire IX in mock dogfights. \n\nDue to the development approaching on the end of the war, the development pace slowed down. The parallel development of the VK-107-powered Yak-9 proved more promising, and in 1946 it was decided to close down the Yak-3 program, and instead divert all VK-107s to the new Yak-9U. Overall, 48 Yak-3 VK-107As were produced in 1945 and 1946.\n\nAdvantages:\nExcellent maneuverability\nSmall size\nStrong armament\n\nDisadvantages:\nLight-weight construction buckling under high Gs\n\n\n
Yak-3R            \n    Yak-3R, 1941\n\nType: Mixed-Power Fighter\n\nWeight:\n Empty: 2,382 kg\n Take-off: 2,980 kg\n\nLength: 8.5 m\nWingspan: 9.2 m\nWing area: 14.85 sq m\n\nEngine: 1 x VK-105PD + 1 x Glushko RD-1\nPower: 1,240 HP; 300 kg/s at sea level\n\nTop speed:\n At 2,700 m: 732 km/h\n At 7,800 m: 782 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 11,800 m\n\nArmament:\n 1 x 23mm NS-23 cannon (60 shells)\n\nIn mid-1944 Soviet Union initiated a crash program to develop jet- or rocket-powered fighters to combat the threat of German aircraft like the Me-262. The requirements called for first flights that same year, but the Soviet aircraft designers quickly realized that the state of Soviet jet engine development would not allow for such quick results. Some of the design bureaus given the task instead initiated two simultaneous projects, a longer-term pure jet development, and a quicker stop-gap project using mixed power.\n\nThe Yakovlev design bureaus Yak-3RD was one of these quick solutions. It was a standard edition Yak-3 with the VK-105PF2 piston engine, and a Glushko RD-1 rocket installed in the tail.\n\nThe single prototype went through flight testing between December of 1944 and May of 1945. The results were encouraging, with the performance generally similar to the excellent Yak-3, plus extra airspeed due to the rocket engine. At altitudes, the airspeed gained was tremendous: at 10,000 meters the Yak-3RD was almost 340 km/h faster than the standard Yak-3!\n\nIn August of 1945 a test pilot was killed, and the investigation failed to uncover the cause. Due to the development of other promising prototypes, and lack of urgency due to peacetime conditions, the program was closed.\n\nAdvantages:\nExcellent maneuverability\nExcellent top speed\n\nDisadvantages:\nInsufficient time of flight with the rocket engine\nLoss of top speed under piston power alone\nWeak armament\n\n\n\n
Yak-7B            \n    Yak-7, model 1941\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 2,477 kg; \n    Take-off: 2,960 kg.\n\nLength: 8.50 m\nWingspan: 10.0 m\nWing area: 17.15 Sq.

Creating a totally new training aircraft that had nothing common with the aforementioned fighters was not expedient; thus a decision was made to build a transitional two-seat dual control training fighter marked UTI -26 (later Yak-7) by modifying the pilot I-26 fighter (later Yak-1). Having been designed as a training plane for air crews preparing to fly the new Yak-7 aircraft, it later went through a number of modifications and lived up to play a more important part than was initially pinned onto it. When the war started, the lack of new combat fighters in the Air Forces spurred up the modification of the two-seater UTI-26 into the Yak-7 combat fighter. In the course of its large-scale production, 18 versions of the Yak-7 would see the light of day, including 5 airframe variations, 6 power-plant variations, 7 armament variations and 1 variation in terms of special equipment. 10 out of 18 Yak-7 versions were produced large-scale. The number of Yak-7s and other Yak versions includes those which underwent the installation of a new engine, new armament or considerable changes in aircraft construction. As with the Yak-1, each subsequent Yak version was an improvement on the previous one. Proof of this is provided, for example, by an increase in maximum Yak-7B speed at sea level from 495 km/h to 532 km/h within the period from October 1942 to November 1943.\n\nOverall, 6,399 Yak-7 units were produced in training and combat versions.\n\nAdvantages: Serial front-line fighter with excellent performance characteristics. High maneuverability and strong armament. Increased aircraft durability. Simple and easily understood controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Defects and shortcomings that originated in the course of mass production led in most cases to a heavier construction.\n

The field trial series entailed only 44 pre-production prototypes. The field trials took place in two time periods: 3.08.1944-18.09.44 and then 15.01.45-15.02.45. 340 sorties were made with 51 combats at altitudes of 100-6,000 m. 8 FW-190s and 4 Bf-109s were shot down and one Yak-9K was lost.\n\nAdvantages: One of the best mass-produced front-line fighters featuring excellent performance characteristics. High maneuverability and very strong armament. Very good aircraft durability. Simple and easy controls. \n\nDisadvantages: Heavy recoil effect of the cannon. Only shooting with 2-3 rounds was possible without losing target direction due to this recoil.\n

In terms of construction, it represented a further Yak-7 development. The Yak-9 differed slightly from the Yak-7DI on the outside, and was in all respects more exemplary since it was designed with two years of experience in Yak-1 and Yak-7 production and actual combat use.\n\nThe Yak-9 was the most mass-produced Yak aircraft and one of the best propeller fighters of the Second World war. All versions had an excellent flight performance, and did not have any structural or maintenance-related fatal defects. The main feature of the Yak-9 was its construction whereby its base was used to create the most diverse combat-purpose aircraft. The Yak-9 had 22 basic versions; 15 of them were produced large-scale. The aircraft came with five different new and modified engine types, six fuel tank variants, seven armament variants and two special equipment variants. Also, the Yak-9 had two essentially differing wing varieties - one with a mixed construction, and another with an all-metal construction. \n\nThe Yak-9T (T-tankoviy- anti-tank version) was a modification of one of the first of two mass-produced Yak-9 with an engine-mounted NS-37 cannon of Nudelman and Suranov design. The planes with this cannon showed perfect results: its 37-mm gun penetrated the upper and rear armor plates of all existing pre-1943 year enemy tanks. At the same time it was still a good, dangerous fighter plane. \n\nAdvantages: One of the best mass-produced front-line fighters featuring excellent performance characteristics. High maneuverability and very strong armament. Increased aircraft durability. Simple and easy controls. \n\nDisadvantages: Big recoil effect of cannon.\n
Yak-9U            \n    Yak-9U\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 2,512 kg; \n    Take-off: 3,204 kg.\n\nLength: 8.55 m.\nWingspan: 9.74 m.\nWing area: 17.15 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: VK-107A.\nPower: 1,500 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 575-600 km/h;\n    At 5,000 m: 672-700 km/h.\n\nTurn time at 1,000 m: 20 sec.\nClimb to 5,000 m: 5 min. \nClimb in a combat turn: 1,280 m.\nService ceiling: 10,650 m.\nRange: 675 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x12.7 mm MG (UBS);\n    1x20 mm cannon (ShVAK).\n\nThe Yak-9U (U for uluchshenny - improved) - was initially a modification of the Yak-9 fighter with a VK-105PF2 engine and improved aerodynamics; however the Yak-9U was not accepted for mass production with this engine. It was decided that the mass-produced Yak-9U would be fitted with a new powerful VK-107A engine and three-bladed VISh-107LO propeller, 3.1m in diameter. The first Yak-9U series had a mixed construction - the fuselage and wing frames were made of metal with plywood paneling. However they gradually gave way to all-metal constructions during production development. \n\nThe Yak-9U was developed in such a way as to enable the installment of any basic aviation armament on the aircraft without the need for essential changes in construction. A number of modifications were introduced up until the end of the war. Eventually, the aircraft met the necessary standards having gone through the tests in NII VVS (Air Forces research institute) before the commencement of mass production (600 km/h at sea level and 700 km/h at 5,000m).\n\nThe results of state tests demonstrated that in 1944, the Yak-9U surpassed all known domestic and foreign fighters in terms of basic flight performance at altitudes of up to 6,000m. \n\n14,579 Yak-9 aircraft of all versions were produced until the end of the Second World war. \n\nAdvantages: One of the best serial front-line fighters featuring excellent performance characteristics. Improved aerodynamics. High maneuverability and strong armament. Ability to climb to the ceiling at non-stop maximum rate of power. Horizontal flight at maximum speed without engine overheat in standard atmospheric conditions. Increased aircraft durability. Simple and easy controls. \n\nDisadvantages: The first serial aircraft had essential shortcomings related for the most part to VK-107A engine operation (overheating and loss of oil).\n
Yak-15            \n    Yak-15, 1941\n\nType: Jet Fighter\n\nWeight:\n Empty: 1,825 kg\n Take-off: 2,742 kg\n\nLength: 8.70 m\nWingspan: 9.20 m\nWing area: 14.85 sq m\n\nEngine: 1 x RD-10 turbojet\nPower: 900 kg/s\n\nTop speed:\n Sea level: 770 km/h\n At 5,000 m: 800 km/h\n Cruise: 689 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 13,350 m\nRange: 510 km\n\nArmament:\n 2 x 23mm NS-23 cannon (60 shells each)\n\nIn mid-1944 Soviet Union initiated a crash program to develop jet or rocket powered fighters to combat the threat of German aircraft like the Me-262. The requirements called for first flights that same year, but the Soviet aircraft designers quickly realized that the state of Soviet jet engine development would not allow for such quick results. Some of the design bureaus given the task instead initiated two simultaneous projects, a longer-term pure jet development, and a quicker stop-gap project to meet the requirement.\n\nThe Yakovlev design bureaus next project was one of these quick solutions. They merely took an all-metal Yak-3U airframe, and replaced the piston engine with a captured German Jumo-004B jet engine, redesignated RD-10 in the USSR. The project was initially called Yak-Jumo.\n\nThe testing program throughout the early 1946 progressed surprisingly well, and the flight tests were completed on June 22nd of that year. After completing state acceptance trials with near-perfect marks, the Yak-15 entered production, holding the distinction of the lightest operational jet-fighter ever built. Pilot conversion was easy, as the aircraft was very similar to the widely-known Yak-3, with the cockpit virtually unchanged.\n\nAltogether, about 280 were built. Some of the production aircraft were built with no armament, or with only one and not two nose cannons, intended to be used as jet conversion trainers. Many of the Yak-15s of the first production run were equipped with actual captured Jumo engines, and not the Soviet copies.\n\nAdvantages:\nEase of conversion from piston to jet engines\nGood maneuverability\n\nDisadvantages:\nManufacturing defects\nExtremely short range\n\n\n


B5N2              \n    Nakajima B5N Kate\n\nType 97 Carrier-Based Attacker\n\nType: Carrier-Based Torpedo and Level Bomber\n\nWeight:\nTake-off: 2,279 kg (5,025 lbs)\nMaximum: 3,800 kg (8,379 lbs)\n\nLength: 10.3 m (33.7 ft)\nWingspan: 15.5m (50.8 ft)\nWing area: 37.7 sq m (123.6 ft)\n\nEngine: 1 x Sakae 11\nPower: 1,000 HP\n\nTop speed:\nSea level: 356 km/h (221 mph)\nAt 3,600 m (11,808 ft): 378 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 7,640 m (25,050 ft)\nRange: 3,000 km (1,863 miles)\n\nArmament:\n1 x 7.7mm machine gun (flex)\nUp to 800kg of bombs\n\nThe Kates story began in 1936, when the Navy issued a new order for a carrier-based attack plane, as torpedo planes were known in Japan, capable of previously unheard of speeds  180 knots or 205 mph at 2,000 meters. The Nakajima company was one of the companies that competed for the contract. They decided not to do a conventional biplane, and instead produced an all-metal monoplane with retractable landing gear using the technology they've previously obtained from American companies such as Northrop and Douglass.\n\nThe design was also remarkable for being the first military aircraft to use fowler flaps. However this design was later replaced with more conventional slotted type. When the prototype first flew in January of 1937 it even exceeded the design speed, reaching 200 knots or 230 mph in level flight. The plane went into production in November of 1937 as Navy Type 97 Carrier Attack Bomber Model 11, or B5N1.\n\nBy the time of Pearl Harbor the initial version was largely replaced with the next variant of the Kate, B5N2. This plane played a pivotal role in the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor. It is estimated that over 50% of the torpedoes sent by the Kates during the attack found their mark.\n\nMain Variants:\nB5N1  initial variant. Nakajima Hikari 3 radial engine at 770 HP\nB5N1-K  advanced trainer variant of the B5N1\nB5N2. New Nakajima N1K1B Sakae radial engine rated at 1,000 HP.\n\nCombat Record:\nThe Kates served with distinction in virtually every area where Japan has fought between 1937 and 1944. They served from carriers and land based and were used both as torpedo bombers against ships, and conventional bombers against land targets. The Kate is certainly one of the most important Japanese aircraft of the Second World War. Its achievements as a bomber are comparable to those of the Zero as a fighter.\n\n\n\n\n
B6N2              \n    B6N2, 1943\n\nType: Carrier-Borne Bomber\n\nAllied Code Name: Jill\n\nWeight:\nTake-off: 5,200 kg\nMaximum: 5,650 kg\n\nLength: 10.86 m\nWingspan: 14.89 m\nWing area: 37.2 sq m\n\nEngine: 1 x Mitsubishi MK4T Kasei 25\nPower: \n1,850 HP for take-off\n1,680 HP at 2,100 m\n\nTop speed:\nAt 4,900 m: 481 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 9,040 m\nRange: 2,000 km\n\nArmament:\n2 \u0425 7.7mm Type 97 machine guns (defensive)\nUp to 800 kg of bombs, or 1 torpedo\n\nThe Tenzan (Heavenly Mountain) bomber was built by Nakajima in the sprint of 1942 to replace the venerable B5N Kate. Both designs were very similar aerodynamically, with the Tenzan exhibiting some interesting design decisions, like the forward-leaning vertical stabilizer, designed to keep the planes length under the specified 11 meters, and an oil cooler shifted to the left side of the fuselage to give way to the torpedo underneath. Despite the external similarities, the B6N was powered by a superior engine, 1,800 HP Mamoru engine, which gave it much better performance than B5Ns Sakae variants, all rated below 1,000 HP.\n\nThe initial design had many problems. Most significantly, the Mamoru engine was too heavy and caused too much vibration. The tailplane surfaces were ineffective due to unexpectedly strong torque. The flight tests dragged on much longer than expected, with the carrier acceptance trials not completed until early 1943. The initial version, designated B6N1, was still troublesome had only 133 examples made. \n\nSoon after going into production, the Ministry of Munitions ordered the production of the Mamoru engine shut down. Nakajima had to redesign the bomber to use the Mitsubishi MK4T Kasei 25 engine, rated at 1,850 HP. Save for the new engine installation the aircraft was basically unchanged. The new variant, designated B6N2, went into production soon after, with production reaching 1,133 B6N2s built by the end of the war. The aircraft turned out to be one of the best carrier-borne bombers of WWII, with performance easily surpassing that of the famous Grumman TBF / TBM Avenger.\n\nMain Variants:\nB6N1  initial production variant, with the Mamoru engine. 133 built\nB6N2  1,850 HP Mitsubishi MK4T Kasei 25 engine. 1,133 built.\nB6N3  prototype intended for use from land bases; 2 built.\n\nAdvantages:\nGreat overall performance\n\nDisadvantages:\nLight bomb load\n\n\nJ2M5, 1944\n\nType: Fighter / Interceptor\n\nAllied Code Name: Jack\n\nWeight:\nEmpty: 2,510 kg\nTake-off: 3,482 kg\n\nLength: 9.94 m\nWingspan: 10.8 m\nWing area: 20.05 sq m\n\nEngine: 1 \u0425 Mitsubishi MK4U-4 Kasei 26a\nPower: \n1,820 HP for take-off\n1,510 HP at 2,800 m\n\nTop speed:\nSea level: 569 km/h\nAt 9,200 m: 696 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 11,250 m\nRange: 1,270 km\n\nArmament:\n4 x 20 mm Type 99 Model 2 cannon (200 rounds per gun)\nUp to 60 kg of bombs, or 2 x 200 l drop tanks\n\nDuring the spring of 1944 Mitsubishi designers were hard at work trying to improve the high-altitude performance of their latest Navy fighter, the J2M Raiden (Thunderbolt). B-29 raids were becoming much more of a problem, and the existing variants of the Raiden left much to be desired when intercepting the Superfortress at altitude. \n\nThe first high-altitude attempt, the J2M4, was powered by a turbo supercharged MK4R-C Kasei 23c engine and equipped with an exhaust turbine. The supercharger allowed the plane to stay at full power above 9,000 meters, as opposed to only 4,800 meters for the J2M3. Unfortunately, the supercharger design was troublesome, and was never perfected enough to enter serial production. Only two J2M4s were built, never going beyond the initial tests.\n\nMitsubishi then tried the MK4U-A Kasei 26a engine with a three-stage supercharger. The new variant, designated J2M5 and officially known as the Mitsubishi Intercepting Fighter Raiden Model 33, was much more successful. It had excellent climb rate, and was also the fastest version of the Raiden.\n\nBy the time the trials were over, the overall situation had become critical. Japanese Navy needed modern fighters to fight off the B-29s, but they could not be built fast enough as those same B-29s were destroying the Japanese manufacturing capacity. Between May 1944 and the end of the war only 34 Raiden Model 33s were built and delivered to front-line units.\n\nMain Variants:\nJ2M5  initial version with 2 x 20mm cannons\nJ2M5 Otsu  J2M5 with 4 x 20mm cannons\n\nAdvantages:\nHigh Speed\nGood performance at all altitudes\nPowerful Armament\n\nDisadvantages:\nPoor rearward visibility\nLow Ammunition\n\n\n\n

The first flight of the XF2A-1 prototype was on December 2nd 1937. The prototype was equipped with a 950HP Wright R1820-22 Cyclone engine and a Hamilton Standard variable pitch propeller. The US Navy accepted the XF2A-1 and ordered serial production of the F2A-1 for its carriers.\n\nThe Brewster Model 239 (F2A-1) was an all-metal single-seat shipboard fighter monoplane with a retractable undercarriage. 54 examples of the model were ordered from the Brewster Aeronautical Corporation by the US Navy, but only 11 F2A-1s entered service starting from June 1939, while the remaining 43 were released for export to Finland.\n\nFinland bought 44 Brewsters (the prototype included!) on December 16th 1939. They were shipped in boxes to Trollh\u00E4ttan, Sweden, and assembled at the SAAB factory. To the Finns' surprise, all US Navy property was removed from the Brewsters at the factory: guns, sights, instruments and carrier equipment. The Finnish B-239 "export" models were equipped with refurbished R-1820G-5 engines taken from DC-3 airliners. After test flights, they were flown to Finland. The first four planes arrived on the 1st of March 1940 and the last by May. The Brewsters were received too late to see any combat during the Winter War.\n\nMany little fixes, changes and improvements were made to the B-239 in Finland. Pilot seat armor and metric instruments were installed. At first separately purchased Aldis-optical (binocular) sights were used, but in the spring of 1941, Finnish V\u00E4is\u00E4la T.h.m.40 reflector sights, which were based on the Revi 3c, replaced them. During the war, the single .30cal machine gun was replaced and by 1943 all except one plane had four .50cal machine guns. The wing guns had 400 rounds per gun and fuselage guns 200rpg (.30cal had 600rpg). \n\nCombat use in the Finnish Air Force \n\nFinnish Brewsters weren't Brewster Buffaloes. They were Model 239s, much closer to the original USN F2A-1, which were reported to be delightful to fly. The Finnish nickname "Taivaan Helmi", "Pearl of the Sky", reflects this. The US Navy received F2A-2s and F2A-3s, which later earned a very bad reputation among pilots in the Pacific theater. They were significantly heavier and less agile than the version that saw service in Finland.  \n\nThe Brewster could turn on a dime and in the early days of the war it was also considered to be pretty fast against the Russian fighters. It had no nasty stall characteristics and it behaved nicely during landing. The take-off was easy with its wide landing gear since the plane was designed for aircraft carrier use. It had a reliable engine and exceptionally good range  - up to four hours. The Brewster was a good and reliable war machine and the pilots felt good about it.\n\nThe Brewster B-239 enjoyed considerable success in the hands of Finnish pilots during WW2. \nIn the course of its combat career in Finland, the Brewster was credited with 496 enemy aircraft destroyed against the loss of 19 Brewsters, a victory ratio of 26:1.\n\nLentolaivue 24 (Fighter Squadron 24) was equipped with the B-239s until May 1944 when the Brewsters were transferred to H\u00E4vitt\u00E4j\u00E4lentolaivue 26 (Fighter Squadron 26). Most of the pilots of the Lentolaivue 24 were Winter War veterans. The Squadron achieved a total of 459 kills in the Brewsters while losing 15 planes in combat, a victory ratio of 30:1.\n\nThe top-scoring Brewster pilot was Hans Wind with 39 kills. Wind scored 26 of his kills while flying a BW-393 and Eino Luukkanen scored 7 more kills with the same plane. The BW-393 is credited with 41 kills in total, making it possibly the single aircraft with the most air victories in the history of air warfare. \n\nF2A versions:\nF2A-1: first production version \nF2A-2: upgraded engine, released October 1940 \nF2A-3: improved airframe, upgraded electronics \nB-239: export version of F2A-1 \nB-339: export version of F2A-2 \n\nFAF numbers:\nBW-351...394 (44 planes)\n\nAdvantages:\nExcellent maneuverability and handling characteristics.

Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG (known as Messerschmitt AG from July 11 1938), received the order to design a new monoplane fighter from the technical department of the Reich Ministry of Aviation.The first Messerschmitt Bf.109V-1 prototype made its maiden flight on May 28 1935, giving an excellent performance. The aircraft was a low-wing monoplane entirely of metal construction and was initially equipped with a Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine (later replaced by a Jumo 210A). Numerous trials and improvements followed the first flight. After the successful tests and excellent performance characteristics of the first Bf.109 prototypes, Messerschmitt was entrusted with its serial production.\n\nThe prototype was followed by serial combat modifications Bf.109 - B (Bruno); C (Caesar) and E (Emil). \n\nThe Bf.109E was the first truly mass-produced Bf.109 variant. It became the Luftwaffe's mainstay fighter before the war and during the first years of World War II.\n\nThe serial Bf-109E was based on the Bf-109V-14 prototype in 1938. The main innovation in this modification was the mounting of a new DB 601A-1 engine (1,100 HP) with fuel injection and an improved supercharger. The fighter was armed with two 7.92mm MG 17 machine guns above the engine and two 20mm MG FF wing cannons.\n\nThe first deliveries of serial aircraft marked Bf-109E-1 started in early 1939. Throughout 1939, Luftwaffe fighting air squadrons were retrained to fly the new type of aircraft and, by the beginning of the Second World War, these planes were adopted by all flying units.\n\nIn the course of the serial production of Bf-109 aircraft, E series, several modifications were developed:\nBf-109E-0 - Pre-serial aircraft. Engine: DB 601A-1. Armament: two 7.92mm machine guns (MG 17) in the wing.\nBf-109E-1 - Serial modification. The planes of the first issues were armed with four 7.92mm guns (MG 17). The following issues had two 7.92mm machine guns (MG 17) and two 20mm cannons (MG FF) in the wing.\nBf-109E-1/B - Modification of fighter-bomber. Serial model Bf-109E-1 with bomb rack for two bombs weighing 50kg each or one bomb weighing 250kg.\nBf-109E-2 - Transitional modification. Armament: two 7.92mm machine guns (MG 17); two 20mm cannons (MG FF) in the wing; and one 20mm cannon in the propeller hub.\nBf-109E-3 - Serial modification. Engine: DB 601A. Armament: two 7.92mm machine guns (MG 17); two 20mm cannons (MG FF) in the wing; and a 20mm cannon in the propeller hub.\nBf-109E-4 - Serial modification. Further development of Bf-109E-3.

The low airspeed and insufficient maneuverability of the Bf-109E-4 caused heavy losses of these aircraft on the eastern front. To improve the situation, some Luftwaffe units started replacing them hastily with faster Bf-109 aircraft of the F series, and it was decided to retrofit the remaining Bf-109 aircraft of the E-4 series into fighter-bombers Bf-109E-4/B - Jagdbomber (Jabo) .\n\nBf-109E-4/B modernization implied mounting on the standard Bf-109E-4 fighter bomb-holders that used to come with Bf-109E-1/B aircraft. Jagdbomber could carry two bombs weighing 50 kg each or one bomb weighing 250 kg. The bombs were released from the cockpit using an electric switch.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent performance characteristics. Good maneuverability and strong armament. Simple and easily understood controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Poor rear view from the cockpit. Short range. Complicated firing from wing guns.\n
Bf-109E-7         \n    Bf-109E-7/B  Jabo (Fighter-bomber), 1940 model\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 1,900 kg.\n    Take-off: 2,670 kg.\n\nLength: 8.7 m.\nWingspan: 9.9 m.\nWing area: 16.4 sq. m.\n\nEngine: Daimler-Benz DB 601A-1.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,045 HP\n    Take-off : 1,175 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level:  470 km/h.\n    At 5,000 m: 546 km/h.\n\nTurn time at an altitude 1,000 m:  26,5-29,4 sec.\nClimb to 3,000 m: 3.1 min.\nClimb in a combat turn: 500 m.\nService ceiling: 11,000 m.\nRange: 480 km (without 300 liter drop tank).\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.92mm (MG 17);\n    2x20mm (MG FF): in the wing;\n    Bombs under 250 kg.\n\nThe small fuel reserve was the main shortcoming in all early modifications of the Bf-109 for it meant the aircraft had a short range. To solve the problem, the Bf-109E-7/B modification was developed (a fighter-bomber), based on the serial Bf-109E-4 aircraft. This modification represented a standard version of the Bf-109E-4 aircraft, which had a bomb rack for mounting an additional fuel tank with a 300-liter capacity. The bomb rack could also be used for mounting a 250 kg bomb.\n\nTo improve the aerodynamic characteristics of the plane, the Bf-109E-7/B modification used a more streamlined spinner instead of a standard spinner which was initially intended for a 20mm engine with mounted cannon firing through the hub.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent performance characteristics. Good maneuverability and strong armament. Simple and easily understood controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Poor rear view from the cockpit. Short range. Complicated firing from wing guns.\n

The new engine installed on this aircraft was constantly overheating with the old type of radiator and, as a result of this problem, the boost pressure was decreased to 1.25 ATA. Use of the GM-1 system was prohibited under 6,500 meters because of the risk of damaging  the engine, but in emergencies  it could provide about 80km/h of extra speed for a short period of time above 6.5km.\n\nPlease also read other info concerning the Bf-109E-7 series in the view object menu.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent performance characteristics. Good maneuverability and strong armament. Simple and easily understood controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Poor rear view from the cockpit. Short range. Complicated firing from wing guns.

The plan was that the improvements would involve few changes in production and no specific material expenditures. Thus it was decided to carry out further development of the Bf-109 F series (Bf-109F) at the expense of improving aerodynamics and cutting down the weight of the basic aircraft.\n\nThe F-series planes were the first of the serially produced Bf-109 aircraft to undergo serious modifications in aerodynamic construction. The propeller fairing was redesigned. It now passed smoothly into a redesigned engine hood. The designers managed to place the radiators more compactly in the wing and the front of the fuselage. The rear part of the fuselage was considerably strengthened. The aircraft received a new wing, with large elliptical tips, that made it possible to increase wingspan and wing area and this in turn led to better flight characteristics. The tail wheel was now semi-retractable and the overall gear design was improved. The weight of the aircraft was reduced by cutting the armaments to two 7.92mm MG 17 machine guns above the engine and one 15mm cannon (MG 151/15) placed in the propeller hub. It was planned to install a new Daimler-Benz DB 601E engine (1,350 HP) on all Bf-109 planes of the F series, but these engines only became available in early 1942 on the Bf-109F-3. Before this modification appeared, the Bf-109F-0, F-1 and F-2 aircraft were equipped with DB 601N engines (1,200 HP).\n\nMain modifications:\n\nBf-109F-0 - Pre-series version. Engine: DB 601N. Armament: two 7.92mm machine guns (MG 17) and one 15-mm cannon (MG FF/M) in the propeller hub.\nBf-109F-1 - Serial version. Engine and armament left unchanged.\nBf-109F-2 - Engine: DB 601N. Armament: two 7.92mm machine guns (MG 17) and a 15mm cannon (MG 151/15) in the propeller hub.\nBf-109F-2/Z - Engine and armament left unchanged. Planes of this modification had a GM-1 device for injecting nitrogen oxide into the engine.\nBf-109F-2/Trop - Tropical modification Bf-109F-2 with an additional air filter on compressor air intake.\nBf-109F-3 - Engine: DB 601E. Armament left unchanged.\nBf-109F-4 - Armament: two 7.92mm machine guns (MG 17) and a 20 mm cannon (MG 151/20) in the propeller hub.\nBf-109F-5 and F-6 - Reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nOver 2,000 Bf-109F aircraft of all modifications were produced.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent performance characteristics. High maneuverability and good armament. Simple and easily understood controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Poor rear view from the cockpit. Short range. Reduced armament.\n

A Daimler-Benz DB 605A-1 engine (power 1.475 HP) was chosen as a power plant. It could develop 1,355 HP at 6,000m using GM-1 boost (the GM-1 was used on some G-versions with pressurized cockpits: it was not used on the Russian front). The new aircraft was supposed to come with a pressurized cockpit that would prevent pressure drops at high altitude and would keep the exhaust gases away from the cockpit. \n\nSerial production of the Bf-109 G series aircraft started in October 1940 and, by the end of 1942, the Bf-109G had practically replaced an earlier Bf-109F model. Together with the FW-190A aircraft, therefore, it comprised the whole aviation fleet of German day-fighters.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nBf-109G-0 - Pre-serial version. Engine: DB 601E. Armament: two 7.92mm machine guns (MG 17) and a 20-mm cannon (MG 151/20) in the propeller hub. Strengthened construction. Pressurized cockpit.\nBf-109G-1 - Serial version. Engine: Daimler-Benz DB 605A-1. Armament left unchanged. Pressurized cockpit.\nBf-109G-1/Trop - Basis: the Bf-109G-1 aircraft. Armament: two 13-mm machine guns (MG 131) and a 20-mm cannon (MG 151/20) in the propeller hub.\nBf-109G-2 - Serial version of the Bf-109G-1 without pressurized cockpit.\nBf-109G-3 - Serial version of the Bf-109G-1 with different radio equipment. Pressurized cockpit.\nBf-109G-4 - Serial version of the Bf-109G-2 with different radio equipment. No pressurized cockpit.\nBf-109G-5 - Serial version. Engine: DB 605A-1 or DB 605AC. Armament: two 13-mm machine guns (MG 131) and a 20-mm cannon (MG 151/20) in the propeller hub. Pressurized cockpit.\nBf-109G-5/U2 - Modified version of the Bf-109G-5. Rear fuselage and tail assembly made of wood.\n\nAdvantages: One of the best serial front-line fighters featuring excellent flight characteristics. Strong armament. Simple and easily understood controls. Very good maneuverability and acceleration. \n\nDisadvantages: Poor rear view from the cockpit. Heavier construction. Short range.\n
Bf-109G-6         \n    Bf-109G-6 Gustav \n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 2,676kg.\n    Take-off: 3,153 kg.\n\nLength: 9.05 m.\nWingspan: 10.6 m.\nWing area: 17.3 sq. m.\n\nEngine: Daimler-Benz DB 605A-1.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,300 HP\n    Take-off : 1,550 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level:  530 km/h.\n    At 7,000 m: 640 km/h.\n\nTurn time at an altitude of 1,000 m: 22,6-22,8 sec.\nClimb to 3,000 m: 3 min.\nClimb in a combat turn: 1,050 m\nService ceiling: 11,200 m\nRange: 545 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x13 mm (MG 131).\n    1x20 mm (MG 151/20) or 1x30 mm (MK 108).\n\nThe new modification of the Bf-109G-6 aircraft became the most common mass-produced model of the Bf-109 range. Production began in autumn 1942. The modification was based on the serial version of the Bf-109G-5, but unlike that version, the plane was produced without a pressurized cockpit. Bf-109G-6 construction was developed in such a way that the armament carried by the aircraft could be changed or increased with the help of special modification sets. The modernization of armament was done using a field modification set (Ruesetsatz) at local airfields or a factory modification set (Umruestaatz) at Messerschmitt factories.\n\nThe Bf-109G-6 late variant became the first Bf-109 aircraft to be equipped with a 30 mm MK 108 cannon firing through the propeller hub. However, because of the fact that production of 30mm MK 108 cannons had just been launched, the first aircraft of the G-6 series were mounted with 20mm MG 151/20 cannons. Apart from the cannon, the plane was equipped with two 13mm MG 131 machine guns placed in the front part of the fuselage (on the outside they looked like bubbles on the upper part of the engine hood, covering the gun mechanisms).\n\nMain modifications:\n\nBf-109G-6/R1 - Serial model of Bf-109G-6 with a mounting for placement of a bomb weighing under 250 kg.\nBf-109G-6/R1 - Bf-109G-6 with standard armament and two under wing launchers for 210mm W.Gr. 21 missiles.\nBf-109G-6/R4 - Bf-109G-6 with standard armament and two additional 30 mm MK 108 cannons placed in under wing gondolas.\nBf-109G-6/R6 - Bf-109G-6 with standard armament and two additional 20mm MG 151/20 cannons in under wing gondolas.\nBf-109G-6/N - Night fighter. Serial model Bf-109G-6 with FuG 350 Naxos navigation device able to intercept emitted signals of H2S airborne radar installed aboard British bombers.\n\nAdvantages: Strong armament. Good field of vision from the cockpit. Simple and easily understood controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Low speed characteristics. Heavier construction. Short range.\n
Bf-109G-6_Late    \n    Bf-109G-6 late Gustav\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 2,656 kg.\n    Take-off: 3,143 kg.\n\nLength: 9.05 m.\nWingspan: 10.6 m.\nWing area: 17.3 sq. m.\n\nEngine: Daimler-Benz DB 605A-1.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,300 HP;\n    Take-off : 1,550 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level:  535 km/h.\n    At 7,000m: 650 km/h.\n\nTurn time at an altitude of 1,000 m: 22,6-22,8 sec.\nClimb to 3,000 m: 2.9 min.\nClimb in a combat turn: 1,080 m\nService ceiling: 11,200 m\nRange: 545 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x13 mm (MG 131).\n    1x20 mm (MG 151/20) or 1x30 mm (MK 108).\n\nGiven the lack of high-quality aluminum for aircraft construction in Germany and the increasing pace of serial production of Bf-109 planes, in 1943 it was decided to launch the production of Bf-109-G planes with wooden tail units. This compulsory modification in the construction of the Bf-109-G did not have much effect on the planes flight performance, but it did have a negative effect on its durability. \n\nOne of the positive modifications in the construction of late-issue Bf-109-G planes was the mounting of a new canopy on the aircraft: the so-called Erla Haube. The new canopy had a simplified, streamlined frame, which considerably improved aerodynamic characteristics and the cockpits field of vision. Additionally, a new armored headrest with thick armored glass was mounted on the pilots seat, which enhanced the field of vision towards the rear.\n\nAdvantages: Strong armament. Good field of vision from the cockpit. Simple and easily understood controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Low speed characteristics. Wooden construction of the aircraft tail unit. Short range.\n\n\n

The water-methanol mixture was in the tank behind the cockpit and its supply was controlled automatically or manually by the pilot. The boost could last for 2 minutes and after that a break of at least 10 minutes was necessary. The main shortcoming of this new Bf-109-G6 modification was short engine durability, with flying-time not exceeding 12 hours.\n\nThe typical outward feature of the new Bf-109-G6/AS modification was the modified fairings of 13-mm MG 131 machine guns that were now oblong and less bulging in form.\nThe aircraft had the same armament and Erla Haube canopy as the previous modifications.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent performance characteristics. Strong armament. Ability to outfly almost any pursuer. Good field of vision from the cockpit. Simple and easily understood controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Very low engine durability. Short range.\n\n

There were delays with the new DB605D engine, so the  Bf-109G-10 went into production later than the Bf-109G-14.  The G-10 was designed  as a streamlined improvement on all the different versions of the Bf-109G-6 and the G-14 series from different manufacturers.  \nThe aircraft was not a further development of the G-series, but it was an attempt to bring the older, repairable aircraft up to standard so that it could be manufactured in parallel with the Bf-109K-4. \nThe main goal was to supplement the production line of the new K-4 with repaired aircraft of almost equal value, using the cheapest methods available. Production started from October 1944. The number of G-10s produced before the end of the war is unknown. Probably about 2,600 aircraft were produced in total, from all manufacturers.\nThe Bf-109G-10 was in service with most front line units equipped with Bf-109s.\n\nFor more info please look for the Bf-109G-6  Bf-109K-4 series on the view object menu.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nBf-109G-10/R1 - Serial model of the Bf-109G-10 with a mounting for the placement of a bomb weighing under 250kg.\nBf-109G-10/R3 - Serial model of the Bf-109G-10 with a mounting for the placement of a 300L drop tank.\nBf-109G-10 /R6  a Bf-109G-10  with standard armament and two additional 20mm MG 151/20 cannons in under wing gondolas.\nBf-109G-10/R7  a Bf-109G-10  with standard armament and two under wing launchers for 210mm WrGr.21 (Nebelwerfer) missiles.\n\nAdvantages: One of the best serial front-line fighters featuring excellent flight characteristics.

Owing to the lack of some materials in wartime, the Messerschmitt production quality standards for this fighter were not fully reached , despite expectations. Only in Hungary did the production quality of the Bf-109 at that time match the Messerschmitts design bureau specifications and, as a result, these planes were of better quality than those produced in Germany. \nThe G-14 was produced in significant numbers and was widely used until the end of the war. The majority of G-14 aircraft were produced with the drop tank/bomb rack under the designation G-14/R-3.\nFor more info, please look for Bf-109G-6/AS in the view object menu.\n\n\n

The idea was to put all the experience acquired during development, production and combat with the earlier Bf-109 fighter modifications into the Bf-109-K modification.\n\nThe Bf-109-K was a modified version of the Bf-109G-10 that now featured a number of improvements. The pre-serial Bf-109-K-0 aircraft appeared in September 1944 and differed from the G series on the outside through its enlarged engine hood under which the place of standard 13mm MG131 machine guns was taken up by new 15mm MG151/15 guns. In addition to the guns, the aircraft was equipped with an engine-mounted 30mm MK 108 cannon firing through the propeller hub.  The aircraft came with a new Daimler-Benz DB 605 DB engine with a GM-1 nitrogen oxide boost that could increase engine power for a short while. During trials of the pre-serial aircraft, it became apparent that the engine operation was not reliable and the aircraft construction was too heavy as a result of installing new armament. Taking the trial results into consideration, the new improved Bf-109K-4 modification was developed. Shipments to Luftwaffe units started as early as October 1944. The Bf-109-K-4 series aircraft came with a more reliable DB 605 D engine, equipped with an MW-50 water-methanol boost that could increase engine power for a short while. The form of the engine hood was changed because a new engine featuring a large two-stage mechanical compressor had been installed. The tail wheel of the aircraft was fully retractable into the fuselage. Armament was cut down to two 13mm MG 131 machine guns and 30mm MK 108 cannon firing through the propeller hub.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent performance characteristics. Strong armament. Ability to outfly almost any pursuer. Good field of vision from the cockpit. Simple and easily understood controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Short range. Due to the end-of-war production problems - bad quality and short life-span of airframe.\n
Bf-109Z           \n    Bf 109Z Zwilling, 1944\n\nType: Heavy Interceptor\n\nWeight:\nTake-Off: 7,290 kg\nMaximum: 8,120 kg\n\nLength: 9.05 m\nWingspan: 13.27 m\nWing Area: 23.2 sq m\n\nEngine: 2 x Daimler-Benz DB 605A-1.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,355 HP\n    Take-off: 1,475 HP\n\nTop speed:\nSea level: 600 km/h\nAt 8,000 m: 740 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 11,700 m\nRange: 2,000 km\n\nArmament:\n2 \u0425 30-\u043C\u043C MK 108 cannon firing through propeller hubs \n2 \u0425 30-\u043C\u043C MK 108 cannons in under wing gondolas\n1 \u0425 30-\u043C\u043C MK 103 cannon in under wing gondola\nUp to 1,000 kg of bombs\n\nBf-109Z was based on the same idea as the He-111Z Zwilling used to two Me-321 Gigant gliders. As the Heinkels creation, Messerschmitt AGs design was a twin design of a serial production plane. The heavy interceptor created by joining two Bf-109s would have good flight characteristics and a significantly stronger armament. It would also need little testing of its own, and could be made on the existing production lines.\nInitial design work on the Bf-109Z started in late 1942. Two serial Bf-109F-4s were used as donors. Airframes were not seriously modified. The main change was a new strut to accommodate a new undercarriage system closer to the fuselage. \nOne wing of each plane (left on one and right on the other) was left completely original, with the exception of the gear well. Two fuselages were connected with a square wing section and a central stabilizer. Prototype was completed in 1943 and was being prepared for flight testing when it was destroyed in one of the air raids.\nSerial Bf-109Z variant was to use the Bf-109G airframe, with both the DB-605A and Jumo-213E engines. As opposed to the American P-82 Twin Mustang, only the left cockpit was to remain, and the right cockpit was to be replaced with a fuel tank.\n\nBF-109Z with DB-605A engines was planned to enter serial production in 1944, however this never materialized and the plane never saw combat.\n\nAdvantages:\nHigh top speed\nGood range\nExtremely powerful armament\n\nDisadvantages:\nManeuverability inferior to the regular Bf-109\n\n\n
Bf-110C-4         \n    Messerschmitt Bf-110C-4 and C-4/B, 1940 model\n\nType: Heavy fighter and fighter bomber\n\nEmpty weight: 5,200 kg \nNormal loaded weight: 6,940 kg \n\nLength: 12 m \nHeight: 3.51 m \nWingspan: 16.28 m\nWing area: 38.37 sq m\n\nEngine: Two 1100HP DB 601A or 1200HP DB601N inverted V-12 engines driving VDM three-blade controllable-pitch propellers\n\nTop speed: \n   Sea level: 480 km/h \n   At 5,000 m: 510 km/h\n   At 7600 m: 562 km/h\nClimb: 676 m/min\nService ceiling: 9,750 m \nRange (internal fuel tanks): 1,300 km\nFuel capacity: 1,268 liters in four wing tanks (internal)\n\nArmament: Four 7.92 mm MG 17 machine guns with 1,000 rounds per gun and two 20 mm MG-FF/M with 180 rounds per gun in nose and one 7.92 mm MG 15 machinegun with 750 rounds in the rear cockpit.\n\nIn June 1934, the RLM issued specifications to the R\u00FCstflugzeug III for a one- or two-engined aircraft with a crew of three to four, a main armament of two 20mm cannons and a defensive armament of two MG 15 machine guns. The Zerst\u00F6rer should be able to attain a top speed of 400kph at an altitude of 6000m, have a range of 2,000km and be able to reach a ceiling of 10,000. In July 1934, three prototypes were ordered. These were the Focke-Wulf Fw 57, the Henschel Hs 124, and the Bf 110. Only the Bf 110 lived up to the expectations of the RLM and its designers.\nThe first Bf 110 to go into mass production was the C-1 model. Armament consisted of 4 MG17 machineguns (7.92mm) and two 20mm Oerlikon MG/FFs mounted under the nose and a rear-firing MG15 for the radio operator. Later in the war, the remaining C-1s were converted to glider tugs and used among other things, in teams of three, to tow the Me321 Gigant. The C-2, C-3 and C-4 models differed from the C-1 in electrical equipment and guns mounted, whereas the C-3 and C-4 received the new MG-FF/M cannons able to fire Minengescho\u00DF shells that had increased destructive power compared to regular HE shells. The C-4 also introduced additional armor protection for the crew. An offspring of the C-4 was the C-4/B fighter bomber version, able to carry 2x 250kg bombs under the fuselage. The C-4/B was largely equipped with the up-rated DB 601N engine. The C-5 model was a reconnaissance version with the MG-FFs removed and a camera installed in their place.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the Bf 110 had a small turning radius for an aircraft of its size and was able to turn quite close to many single-engine fighters. Its slow roll speed made it very vulnerable in these fights, though, since a more nimble single-engine fighter could change the direction of its turn and therefore get behind it. \n\nDuring the Polish campaign, the Zerst\u00F6rer units achieved considerable success in bomber escort and free hunting roles. They also strafed ground targets with good effect.\n\nIn the Invasion of Norway, the Bf 110 was the only available fighter in the Luftwaffe to have enough range to reach Norway from bases in Germany. It was used to escort bombers and also paratroopers in their Ju 52s who were to occupy key points in southern Norway.\nDuring the Battle of France, the Bf 110 was tried by Erprobungsgruppe 210 in the fighter-bomber role. This units task was to test the standard fighters operationally with the Luftwaffe in new and different roles. They continued to do this during the Battle of Britain, showing that the Bf 110 was well-suited for a ground attack role. Erp. Gr. 210 was also the sole Zerst\u00F6rer equipped unit to operate the C-6 version, a tank buster mounting a 30mm MK 101 cannon in an underbelly tray with the MG-FFs removed.\n\nInitially in the Battle of Britain, the Zerst\u00F6rer units enjoyed some success when used in free roaming patrols, diving with their formidable armament blazing at their opponents. This quickly changed, however, when they were used as escort to bombers, in particular when used as close escorts, resulting in the Bf 110s suffering heavy losses to the much more nimble Hurricanes and Spitfires. In the end, the Bf 110s had to have escorts of Bf 109s when used as close escorts for bombers.\nIt was in the ground attack role that the Zerst\u00F6rer would find its new lease of life during the opening of Operation Barbarossa. Largely because of the relatively low number of modern fighters on the Soviet side in the early part of the campaign, the Bf 110s were able to operate successfully in the interdiction role, attacking Soviet airfields, supply lines, troop concentrations and strong points. Here the nose-mounted armament played havoc with anything unfortunate enough to be caught at the receiving end. It was still used in the role as fighter in the same manner as it had in the early part of the Battle of Britain and sometimes even with notable success. Anti-Aircraft fire caused the majority of losses early in the campaign.\nHowever, Bf 110 production was terminated in 1941 so the losses dwindled the strength of the Zerst\u00F6rer units to the degree that, by late 1941, most were withdrawn from the Russian front. During late 1941/early 1942, Bf 110 production was started again as the Me 210A (its intended replacement) suffered from severe problems. Bolstered up to strength once more, several Zerst\u00F6rer units returned to the Russian front in early 1942 in support of the expected Wehrmacht offensives. \nStill proving its worth in the ground attack role, it now suffered considerably higher losses due to the significantly higher number of more modern Soviet fighters. One by one the Zerst\u00F6rer units were pulled off the front, due to losses and the need for the Zerst\u00F6rer to defend Germany against Allied air raids, with the last one leaving in March 1943. That is, with one exception  13(Z) JG 5  which operated in northern Norway, Finland and Russia until February 1944.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent firepower. Good turning radius. Very pleasant and safe to fly in normal flight.\n\nDisadvantages: \nSlow roll rate. Rather heavy control forces at medium to high speeds. Slow speed compared to mid and late war fighters.\n\n\n

Bf-110G-2         \n    Bf-110G-2 , 1943 model\n\nType: Heavy fighter and fighter-bomber\n\nEmpty weight: 5,700 kg \nNormal loaded weight: 7,300 kg \n\nLength: 12.10 m \nHeight: 4.13 m \nWingspan: 16.28 m \n\nEngine: Two 1,475HP DB 605B inverted V-12 engines driving VDM three-blade controllable-pitch propellers\n\nTop speed: \nSea level: 510 km/h \nAt 5,000 m: 570 km/h \nAt 7,300 m: 595 km/h\nClimb: 703 m/min up to 5,500 meters\nService ceiling: 11,000 m \nRange (internal fuel tanks): 1,000 km\nFuel capacity: 1,268 liters in four wing tanks (internal)\n\nArmament: Four 7.92 mm MG 17 machine guns with 1,000 rounds per gun , two 20 mm MG 151/20 with 300-350 rounds per gun in nose and one twin 7.92 mm MG 81Z machinegun with 400 rounds per gun in the rear cockpit.\n\nThe G-series was the last production series of Messerschmitts famous twin-engined fighter and the G-2 was the last dayfighter version. Initially produced with the same armament as the previous versions, several R\u00FCsts\u00E4tze (equipment kits) were made available which changed the equipment: \n\nG-2/R1 : Substituting the 2xMG 151/20s for a tray-mounted BK 3.7 cannon\nG-2/R2 : GM-1 nitrous oxide power-boost system fitted\nG-2/R3 : Nose MG 17s replaced by two 30mm MK 108 cannons\nG-2/R4 : Combination of R2 and R3 applied to the aircraft\nG-2/R5 : Combination of R1 and R3 kits\n\nAnd additionally there was a number of M (munition) and B (betrieb) r\u00FCsts\u00E4tze:\n\nB1: A streamlined tank containing 75 liters of oil was positioned under the rear fuselage; it was utilized in conjunction with the fitting of the 900-liter jettisonable fuel tanks placed under the wings.\nB2: Related to the carriage of either the 300-liter or 900-liter under-wing tanks.\nM1:  A twin 20mm MG 151/20 cannon mounting in a ventral tray under the central fuselage.\nM2: Two ETC500/IXb bomb racks located under the central fuselage and covered by streamlined fairing. Load combinations included two SC or SD 250 bombs as well as the larger PC1000 type of ordnance; normal maximum load related to the SC or SD250 bombs.\nM3: Pairs of ETC50/VIIId racks in streamlined carriers under the outer wings. Loads included SC or SD50 or SD50F bombs. Other variations involved BdC 10 bomblet containers, LC50F parachute flares or S 125 smoke generators.\nM4: Two SD2/XII racks in streamlined carriers placed under each outer wing, each capable of accommodating a maximum of twenty-four SD2 Butterfly anti-personnel bombs.\nM5: The mounting of a pair of WrGr 21 tubes under each wing.\n\nThe first Bf 110G-2 was issued to frontline units in spring of 1943. It had improved performance over previous versions but was still far too vulnerable in its originally intended role of heavy dayfighter. This version briefly enjoyed success as a Pulk-Zerst\u00F6rer (Formation Destroyer) against the daylight bombing raids over Germany, but the arrival of long-range escorts all but chased them away from the sky.\n\nThe G-3 series was a reconnaissance version similar to the C-5. G-3s were used on the Russian front for some time before being replaced by Me 410s and Ju 88s. These aircraft were then modified into the same armaments as the G-2 version.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent firepower. Good turning radius. Very pleasant and safe to fly in normal flight.\nDisadvantages: Slow roll rate. Rather heavy control forces at medium to high speeds. Slow speed compared to mid and late war fighters.\n\n\n

This was Japans first all-metal low-wing monoplane dive bomber.\nWhile some Heinkel influence is noticeable in the airplane, the shape of the dive brakes and the fixed landing gear are purely a coincidence. Everything in the aircraft was designed to stay stable and withstand the stress of a high-speed dive. However the plane turned out to be so maneuverable that it was often used as a fighter after the bombs were dropped.\n\n\nMain Variants:\nD3A1  Initial Version. 1,075 HP Kinsei 44 engine\nD3A2  More powerful 1,200 HP Kinsei 54 engine. Increased fuel capacity for longer range.\nD3A2-K  Advanced trainer on the base of D3A2\n\n\nCombat Record:\nDuring the early period of the war Vals enjoyed considerable success. In addition to the Pearl Harbor attack, theyve also sank the British aircraft carrier Hermes in the Indian ocean, as well as two cruisers. While the IJN still retained its most experienced pilots, Vals averaged 80% bomb hitting rate. After the battle of Midway however and horrendous losses in the Solomons it dropped as low as 10% and less. \nIn the last months of the war Vals were used as kamikaze aircraft.\n\n\n\n\n

The aircraft fixed landing gear had two spring supports. The cockpit housed a crew of three and had excellent field of vision. The aircraft came with an Argus As 10C engine and two 150 l fuel tanks placed in the center section of the wing.\n\nThe trial results revealed unique Fi-156 characteristics: the plane required only 30 meters to take off in a wind of 13 km/h, and only 16 meters of runway to land at the same wind speed using wheel brakes. \n\nWith characteristics like that, the aircraft complied ideally with the requirements for an army-geared aircraft and could be used successfully in short-range reconnaissance or a liaison and communication role. And so the Fi-156 was adopted and serial production began.\n\nFi-156 serial production began in spring 1937 and, from the early winter of 1937, it was shipped to Luftwaffe units. Flight tests in Luftwaffe units revealed that the Fi-156 could be used to evacuate the wounded (the stretcher could be placed in the cabin), create smoke-screens or drop goods, and it also served as a sea patrol aircraft or even a bomber capable of carrying a bomb load of up to 150kg.\n\nIt was used throughout World War II on all fronts, including the famous operation to liberate Benito Mussolini in 1943, led by Hauptsturmfuerer SS Otto Scortseni.\nAbout 2,900 Fi-156 aircraft of different modifications were built between 1937 and 1945. After the war, the Fi-156 was produced by French and Czechoslovakian factories.\nIf modeled in Il-2, at a low power setting and with a strong headwind the Storch could actually fly backwards!\n\nAdvantages: The best multi-purpose army aircraft of World War II. Excellent flight characteristics. Ability to take off and land at extremely short distances. Simple construction. Multifunctional. Excellent field of vision from the cockpit.\n

The He-46 was replaced by a plane with a new design, the Hs-126, which made its maiden flight in autumn 1936. Although the Hs-126 fully met Luftwaffe demands and the RLM was planning to completely replace the outdated He-46 with it, in 1937 the Reich Air Ministry's technical department opened a competition to design a reconnaissance aircraft with a 3-man crew, 360-degree field of vision and flight characteristics superior to other aircraft of a similar class. Hamburger Flugzeugbau GmbH presented its BV.141 project; Focke-Wulf its FW-189; and Arado its Ar.198. The BV.141 project was rejected by the commission almost immediately because of its extremely unusual construction and - although many experts were in favor of the Arado project (a classic one-engine Ar.198 plane) - the competition was won by the FW-189 project for a twin-engine twin-boom aircraft with crew gondola between the booms. The decisive features that influenced decision-making were: the almost wholly glazed cockpit with defensive armament in all main directions; the two-engine design; and the excellent flight characteristics and multifunctionality that were expected of the plane.\n\nFW-189-V1 prototype development was led by E. Kozela. The plane FW-189-V1 was first flown by its designer, Kurt Tank, in July 1938. Except for the double tail assembly, the FW-189 did not in fact differ from conventional planes. It had an all-metal construction. The three-spar wing had a rectangular center section with an almost fully glazed crew gondola in the middle. The main and rear spars passed through the gondola. The gear legs retracted hydraulically backward to the tail beams and were closed with shutters. The tail wheel was retracted sideways into a horizontal stabilizer. The aircraft came with two Argus As-410 engines, rated 430 HP each. It boasted excellent responsiveness to controls during flight trials and fairly good flight characteristics.\n\nAt the beginning of 1939, the decision was taken to produce the FW-189A-0 series. However, Luftwaffe headquarters came to the conclusion that there was no need for such an aircraft at the moment because the adopted Hs-126 reconnaissance plane met the same requirements perfectly.\n\nIn the summer of 1940, the French campaign revealed the obvious shortcomings of the Hs-126 and Focke-Wulf was entrusted with the serial production of the FW-189A-1 for later use by the Luftwaffe.\n\nThe A-1 version differed from the prototype only in insignificant details. Standard armament consisted of two fixed 7.92mm MG 17 machine-guns in the wing and two movable 7.92mm MG 15 machine-guns placed in the upper and rear lower part of gondola. If need be, four 50kg bombs could be carried: they could be dropped when diving or in horizontal flight. A camera was installed in a special socket in the fuselage floor. The aircraft also carried special equipment: a radio station and direction-finder.\n\nIn mid-1941, the new modification of the FW-189A-2 reconnaissance aircraft was developed. It came with coupled MG 81Z machine-guns of 7.92mm caliber instead of the basic MG 15 machine-guns, but the wing machine-guns were left unchanged. The rear part of the gondola could be rotated, thereby extending the firing zone.\n\nThe FW-189 aircraft was used from 1940 through to the last days of the Second World War. It was used for the most part on the Eastern front. Its combat effectiveness was flawless. The aircraft could be controlled even if one of the engines was damaged and could land in these conditions without much difficulty. It could fulfill tasks in the most unfavorable combat and weather conditions. The aircraft turned out to be highly maneuverable and could avoid most fighter attacks. Its defensive armament was sufficient to hold enemy attacks in check.\n 864 FW-189 planes of all modifications were produced.  \n\nMain modifications:\n\nFW-189A-0 - Pre-serial version of reconnaissance aircraft.\nFW-189B - Training aircraft prototype.

Fw-190A-4         \n    FW-190 A-4, 1942 model\n\nType: Fighter \n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 3,273 kg.\n    Take-off: 3,989 kg.\n\nLength: 8.860m.\n    Wingspan: 10.520 m.\n    Wing area: 18.609 sq. m.\n\nEngine: BMW801D-2.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,460 HP;\n   Take-off: 1,580 HP (1,780 HP / 1 min) 2400 rpm, 1.42 ATA\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 540 km/h.\n    At 6,000 m: 648 km/h.\n\nTurn time at 1,000 m:  23-24 sec.\nClimb to 5,000 m: 6.8 min.\nClimb in a combat turn: 700-750 m.\nService ceiling: 10,500 m.\nRange: 983 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x20 mm (MG FF) + 2x20 mm (MG 151): in the wing.\n    2x7.92 mm (MG 17).\n\nIn 1937 the Bf-109 aircraft developed by Messerschmitt was adopted as the main Luftwaffe fighter. The  Reich Ministry of Aviations technical department developed a new specification for fighter development so as not to confine itself to just one fighter type. Focke-Wulf was one of the numerous companies that received the specification and set to work on the new fighter immediately.\n\nA radial BMW 139 engine (rated at 1,550 HP) was chosen for the new plane. The design was entrusted to a team of developers led by chief engineer R. Blazer and started in mid-1938. In the spring of 1939, a first prototype -the FW-190V-1 - was assembled. It made its first flight on July 1 1939. After test flights, the prototype was handed over to the Luftwaffe research center for full-scale trials. In the course of the tests, the FW-190V-1 displayed excellent flight characteristics, good stability and simple controls; furthermore, the plane distinguished itself with its high landing stability thanks to solid gear with a wide track. Among the shortcomings discovered when testing were bad field of vision at taxiing caused by a cumbersome radial engine and constant engine overheating which led to a temperature increase in the cabin. The cooling system was re-designed and the aircraft went through further tests. After that, the construction of the first pre-serial FW-190V-0 was ordered.\n\nDespite the agreement reached, production of the pre-serial FW-190 aircraft was postponed. This was due to the fact that BMW had stopped producing the BMW 139 engines intended for the FW-190. In consequence, a new version of the fighter was developed - the FW-190V5. The modernized aircraft came with a BMW 801C-0 engine (1,560 HP) which was much heavier than the previous engine, and involved strengthening the under-engine frame. To make up for the heavy engine, the cockpit was moved almost 30cm back, thereby improving the field of vision and reducing overheating from the engine. The armament of the new fighter consisted of two 7.92mm MG 17 machine-guns, two 20mm MG FF wing cannons and two 7.92mm MG 17 machine-guns above the engine. Wingspan was increased. \n\nIn 1941, the FW-190V5 underwent successful flight tests in this configuration, with some minor improvements, and serial production began in the spring. It was marked FW-190A-1. \n\nIn August 1941, production of a new improved FW-190A-2 modification started. The armament of the modified fighter consisted of two 20mm MG FF cannons, two 20mm MG 151/20 cannons in the wing and two 7.92mm MG 17 machine-guns above the engine. The system of weapons selection meant that any pair of cannons or machine-guns could be used separately or simultaneously. The aircraft came with an improved BMW801C-2 (rated 1,600 HP at take-off). Armor consisted of armored glass, a 14mm headrest, an 8mm armored back and small 8mm tiles above, below and on the sides of the armored back.\n \nThe next FW-190 modification was the FW-190A-3 aircraft that appeared in 1942. The plane was equipped with a new BMW801D-2 engine (rated 1,724 HP at take-off). Among the typical external features, one should mention the introduction of vent slots for cooled air on the side panels behind the engine.\n\nIn the course of 1942, the FW-190A-3 was gradually replaced on factory production lines by a new FW-190A-4 modification. \n\nThe FW-190A-4 was used for the first time on the Russian front in the winter of 1942-43.\n\nAdvantages: One of the best serial front-line fighters. Good flight characteristics. Simple and comfortable to control and maintain. Strong firepower. Good field of vision from the cockpit. Reliability. Good armor for the crew and power plant. \n\nDisadvantages: Insufficient field of vision from the cockpit at taxiing.\n

In contrast to the previous FW-190A-4 modification, the new model had a greater overall length. The increase in length was caused by the use of a longer strengthened under-engine frame, which reduced engine vibration and increased stability. This longer engine frame led to the appearance of new panels connecting the fuselage with the engine fairing and one more panel at the bottom of the fuselage between the wing and the engine. Regulated cowl flaps were now used to vent cooled air instead of the usual slots. \n\nA large number of modification sets were developed and tested for this modification (as in the case of the Bf-109 fighter). They made it possible for the serial fighter to be retrofitted into an attack plane, a fighter-bomber, a reconnaissance aircraft, a night fighter and even a torpedo-carrying fighter. The multipurpose role of the FW-190A-5 fighter is proved by the number of sub-modifications that were based on it:\n\nFW-190A-5/U2 - Long-range night fighter-bomber. Anti-icing covering and flame exhaust hiding device introduced. E\u0422C-250 under fuselage racks for two drop tanks under the wing (capacity - 300 liters each).

Its mass production began in February of 1944. This version became the most mass-produced model of all FW-190s. It was constructed in all Focke-Wulf factories and other companies that produced the FW-190 under license.  \n In terms of construction, the new version was based on the FW-190A-7 fighter with added facilities to install a 115-liter tank placed behind the pilot. This tank could contain fuel or be replaced by MW50 or GM1 tanks. The boost (special emergency power) was initiated by an extra injection of fuel. This had an anti-explosion effect and served to cool the fuel mixture, somewhat like the MW50. Uninterrupted use of the Special emergency power was possible for 10 minutes, after which time the engine needed to cool down. To counter the weight of the tank and fuel, the designers had to modify the fuselage design. The radio station was moved forward to counterbalance the increased weight; E\u0422C-501 racks were moved in a fashion similar to the A6 or A7 equipped with the GM1 device. The maximum payload was a 1,000-kg bomb but 500 kg was more common.\n\n Main modifications:\n\nFW-190A-8/R1 - Fighter. Armament: 2 MG 151 guns of 20 mm caliber - in the wing, 2 pods of 2 MG 151 guns 20 mm and 2 MG 131 machine-guns of 13 mm caliber mounted in the engine cowling.\nFW-190A-8/R2 - Fighter. Armament: 2 MG 151 guns of 20 mm caliber + 2 MK 108 guns of 30 mm caliber - in the wing and 2 machine-guns MG 131 of 13 mm caliber mounted in the engine cowling.\nFW-190A-8/R3 - Fighter. Armament: 2 MG 151 guns of 20 mm caliber - in the wing + 2 MK 103 cannons of 30 mm caliber - under wing pods and 2 MG 131 machine-guns of 13 mm caliber mounted in the engine cowling.\nFW-190A-8/R7 - Ramjaeger. Armament: 4 MG 151 guns of 20 mm caliber - in the wing and 2 MG 131 machine-guns of 13 mm caliber mounted in the engine cowling. Increased armor for pilot and engine.\nFW-190A-8/R8 - Ramjaeger. Armament: 2 MK 108 guns of 30 mm caliber and 2 MG 151 guns of 20 mm caliber - in the wings and the improved armor of the A8/R7.\nFW 190 A8 TS and A9  from June 1944 the BMW 801 engine was replaced with the more powerful BMW 801 TS, also known as the BMW 801 Q . This engine was a hybrid of the BMW 801 E (known as BMW 801 TH) and the BMW 801 D. The airframe was the same but the engine output was significantly better and the critical altitude higher.\nFW-190A-8/U1 - Two-seater training aircraft, also known as the FW 190 S-8.\n\nFurther development:\n\nThe need for a modern attack aircraft rose as the war progressed. This led to the production of the FW190 F and FW 190 G versions. Both had their roots in the modified A4 and A5 that were used as prototypes and pre-series versions.\nThe FW-190F was an attack plane. It stemmed from the A4/U3 (F1) and A5/U3 (F2). The F3 was a development of the F series and the F8 was basically an A8 with reduced armament.\nTypically, the plane had reinforced fuselage armor from the fuel tank to the nose, although this was dropped from the F8 onwards. The armament was reduced to 2 MG 131s in the cowling and 2 MG 151/20 in the wing roots.\nThere were several field or factory modifications, as well as many additional tests. The most common variant was the R1 with two 50 or 70 kg bombs under each wing. The maximum payload was one 500 kg and four 50 or 70 kg bombs. In the fall of 1944, some planes were converted for the anti-tank role using panserschrek and later panzerblitz I and II rockets. Take-off weight for this modification was 4,300 kg  + payload.\nThe main versions were the F1, F2, F3 and F8.\nThe latest versions were the F9 and F15 (the F15 was an F9 with the ETC 504 rack instead of the ETC 501). The F9 was an F8 with a BMW 801 E or F.\n\nThe G series was one of long-range attack planes. As with the F series, the origins of this series are the A4/U8 (G1) and A5/U8 (G3). The idea was to carry two external 300-liter tanks under the wings.\nConsequently, the armament was reduced to 2 MG 151/20 and the external guns were deleted as well as the MG 17 or MG 131. Most of the planes were equipped with the Pks11 navigation system. Starting with the G2 version, the plane had an ability to carry up to two 250-kg bombs under the wings instead of the fuel tanks. Some versions were adapted to night operation with landing lights and flame dampers (mainly G2 and G3). The maximum bomb load was a single 1,800-kg bomb or one 500 kg and two 250-kg bombs. The R5 conversion kit enabled the wing hard points to carry four 50-kg or four 70-kg bombs.\nThe take-off weight was 3,990 kg + payload.\nThe main series were the G1, G2, G3 and G8.\n\nAdvantages: Good flight characteristics.

This engine received some of its drive components from the BMW 801 F, the BMW research engine. This was the forerunner of the A9. The A9 had the same airframe as the A8, but used features that were optional in the A series, and used the latest development in the BMW801 F engine which led to the BMW 801 S and E (also known as the BMW 801 TS and TH). It had the wide 3.3m diameter propeller blade, either in wood or in metal. Some of the planes produced were equipped with the bubble canopy and the modified head armor support.  There is a bit of controversy about what the BMW 801 TH is  whether E or F  or if the A9 had a wooden or metal made wide propeller. \nProbably the BMW801 F is the research engine designation and E is the production version. As far as the propeller is concerned, there is evidence of both types being used.\nBy January 1945, the TS engine was serially produced with a device similar to the erh\u00F6nte Notlesitung of the A8. It is very likely that the kit was used on both the BMW801 TH/TS engines before that date. The BMW 801 D and the BMW 801 Q used that boost and it was serially mounted on the engine from June 1944 onwards. \n\nAdvantages: Same as the A8. Simple and easy to control and maintain.  Strong firepower and multifunctional. Good field of vision from the cockpit in flight. Reliable. Improved armor for the oil tank and oil cooler and improved climb characteristics (use of a high efficiency propeller).\n\nDisadvantages:  Poor field of vision while taxiing, due to the nose-up position. High G stall, as all the FW can be very snappy, and with little warning.\n\n\n

It seemed that there was no battlefield use for which the FW-190 could not be exploited. However, when the Second World War started, the Luftwaffe had no aircraft that could fulfill the functions of a high-altitude fighter. In those years, Luftwaffe headquarters were in favor of a high-altitude bomber that was practically inaccessible for interceptors and denied the very idea of defensive tactics - impossible for anything but a high-altitude fighter.\n  However, the development of high-altitude fighters was being conducted in Germany long before the direct threat of enemy high-altitude bombers became apparent. One of the companies carrying out such projects was Focke-Wulf.\n  The concept of creating a high-altitude fighter involved designing a new aircraft based on the mass-produced FW-190A fighter. Several modifications of the standard aircraft were considered. The changes introduced mostly involved installing new engine types or modernizing pre-existent engines. The first version, marked FW-190B, was equipped with a radial BMW 801 J engine and, in contrast to the A series, was equipped with a powerful turbo-supercharger and pressurized cockpit. It was followed by another modification - the FW-190C - initially equipped with a 1,750 hp DB 603A in-line engine and later with a DB 603G engine. Tests revealed the unsatisfactory characteristics of the superchargers and it was decided to shift the main emphasis towards introducing a new, powerful Jumo 213 engine on the FW-190D series.\n  The new aircraft was based on the standard FW-190A-8 airframe. As opposed to the BMW engined fighter, it had a 12-cylinder liquid cooled inline Jumo 213A engine rated at 1,740 hp. The new engine's installation prolonged the fuselage, compensated for by a larger tail fin. Flight tests of the new plane produced excellent results and large-scale production was launched.\n  A small preproduction series of FW-190D-0 planes was produced in 1943 which involved modernizing the standard FW-190A-7 airframes. It was followed by a small FW-190D-1 series, the aircraft of which differed from the preproduction version by their larger surface of empennage (vertical stabilizer). The alteration of existing airframes usually tied in with the installation of a new engine and fuselage insert placed right in front of the empennage. The latter counterbalanced the front part of the fuselage, which was elongated to accommodate the new engine.\n  The first mass-produced model of the D version to go into production in June 1944 was the FW-190D-9, which was intended to replace the FW-190A-8. Aircraft in this series were equipped with Junkers Jumo 213A-1 engines. During the combat unit evaluations, the plane was found to be good, but extra speed was needed. The MW50 water-methanol injection system was introduced in January 1945. In the meantime, as of September 1944, a petrol injection, similar in principle to the one used on the A8, was used and was later complemented with a simpler MW50 device.\nFighter armament consisted of two 20-mm MG 151/20 guns in the wing and two 13-mm MG 131 machine-guns. The ETC 504 rack could either carry a 250 kg bomb, a 300-liter external fuel tank or four 50 or 70-kg bombs on the ETC4 adapter.\nThe number of planes produced is very uncertain, and lies somewhere between 700 and 2000. The D9 was by far the largest version built. It is difficult to ascertain its exact composition as most of the parts were interchangeable between versions, especially the engine. It is very possible that hybrids were produced. A D13 flew with the squadron charged to protect the Gallands Jagdverband 44. As far as I know, only one D12 was produced.\n\nMain modifications:\nFW-190D-9/R11: All-weather fighter. Equipped with PKS 12 course steering system and improved Hermine-type radio.\nFW-190D-10:  Analogous to the D-9.

Fw-190F-8         \n    FW-190 F-8, 1944 model\n\nType: Fighter-bomber\n\nWeight: (with ETC 501 and two ETC50 (14 kg each)\n    Empty: 3,415 kg \n    Take-off: 4,150 kg, 4270 with the 115-liter back tank\n\nLength: 8.950 m\nWingspan: 10.520 m\nWing area: 18.609 sq m\n\nEngine: BMW-801D-2 or BMW 801 Q (BMW 801 TU)\nPower: (at sea level)\n    Climb and combat            : 1,450 HP at 2,400 rpm and 1.32 ATA\n    Take-off and emergency  : 1,750 HP at 2,700 rpm and 1.42 ATA\n    Special emergency power: 2,050 HP at 2,700 rpm and 1.65 ATA (Only usable under 1,000 m)\n\nSpeed with the ETC rack: (with 1 x 250 kg bomb and 4 x 50 kg bomb)\n    Sea level: 535 km/h (500)\n   With WEP: 565 (520)\n    At 6,500 m: 630 km/h (595) no boost available \nTurn time at 1,000m: 24 sec\nClimb to 5,000 m: 6.8 min (at combat and climb regime)\nService ceiling: 10,400 m\nRange: 500 km\n\nArmament:\n    2 x 20 mm (MG 151/20 with 250 rounds each): wing root\n    2 x 13 mm (MG 131 with 475 rounds each): nose cowling\n\nAs we have already said in the A8 presentation in the view object menu, the war engendered a need for a modern ground attack aircraft, and this led to the production of the FW190 F and the FW 190 G version. \nCompared to the A8, the F8 was pretty much the same. It had more or less the same equipment of the radio, a Fug 16 ZS to interface with ground units and the gun camera in the wing. Unlike the previous F series, the plane did not carry the ground attack armor any more, mainly because the serially installed armor on the FW 190 A8 was deemed satisfactory.\nIt seems that the most common version was the R1 (with two ETC 50s under the wings). The production sheets do not mention any F8s without the R-kit) so we assume that the R1 was in fact the basis for the series.\nThe other main difference is that the F8 used an earlier version of the petrol injection with an expendable inter cooler and this was only usable below 1,000m altitude.\n\nThe possible payloads were as follows:\nCentral point on ETC 501 (or 504) \n300L external fuel tanks, 250 or 500kg bomb or with ER4 adapter 4 x 70kg or 4 x 50kg bombs\n\nUnder wings\n2 times 2 50 or 70kg bombs or with ETC 503 2*250kg bombs\n\nThe bomb could be AB (sub munition container), SC (general purpose), SD (fragmentation) normal or with delay or spike. \n\n\nTechnically there is no problem for a FW-190F-8 to carry a 1000 kg SC or SD bomb. However, there is a tactical restriction.  The FW 190 is limited to a take-off weight of 5,200kg for a front line airfield, for reasons of ground clearance. With a normally loaded FW 190 F8, a 1,000kg bomb would be over that limit.\nAll F8s, F9s and derived versions could be equipped the ETC 503 (it was a kit) to replace the ETC 50 and to be able to carry 2 x 250kg bombs under the wings. (The F8/U1 was a test-bed for the adaptation of the Messerschmitt wing carrier and release mechanism used on the G series.)\nThe F9 was equipped with larger wheels and the extended tail wheel to get around this problem.\n\nMain modifications\n\nFW-190F-8/PB1  Attack Fighter. Armament: 2 MG 151 guns of 20mm caliber - in the wing  and 2 MG 131 machine-guns of 13mm caliber above engine hood. By late 1944.\nThe ETC 50s were modified to carry 6 or 8 tubes of RM4 rockets adapted to tank busting called Panzerblitz.\nThe predecessor was using Panzerschek rockets and was tested and used by fall 1944.\nThe PB1 evolved into the PB2, which is a PB1 with a more powerful warhead.\n\nFW-190A-F8/R3  Attack-Fighter Armament: 2 MG 151 guns of 20mm caliber - in the wing + 2 MK 103 guns of 30mm caliber - under wing pods \n\nFW-190F-9/R1  like the F8/R1, but with a more powerful BMW 801 TH/TS and a wide wooden propeller (3.5m diameter). The FW-190 F9 is about 10 to 15km faster that a F8.\nFW-190F-15/R1  like the F9/R1, but with an ETC 504 ventral carrier for an increase of 5km/h and with the Fug15 a modernized version of the Fug 16 ZY/ZS.\n\nFW-190F-16  like the F15/R1, but with a more powerful BMW 801 TH/TS or TF.\nTo be equipped with a TSA-2 bombing aiming device, a Patin PK 12 course steering and a Fug 125 Hermine radio. Others were to be equipped with the Fug 15 and a modernized version of the Fug 16 ZY/ZS.\n\nThe FW-190F-8, F-9, F-15, F-16 were extensively tested for torpedo-carrying and there were several prototypes. They were all equipped with the TSA-2 bombing aiming device, with a Patin PK 12 course steering and a Fug 125 Hermine radio.\nThe designations were FW 190F-8/U2, FW 190F-8/U3, FW 190F-8/U4, FW 190F-8/U5, FW 190F-8/U14, FW 190F-8/U15. Some of these saw action in KG 200, but in the end it was a relatively marginal number. Most of these prototypes were modified or followed up with the F9, F15 and F16.\n\nAdvantages: Good flight characteristics. Simple and easy to control and maintain. Good armament. Multifunctional. Good field of vision from the cockpit. Reliable. Good armor for the crew and power plant.  \n\nDisadvantages: Insufficient field of vision from the cockpit at taxiing. \n\n\n\n

First of all, by the beginning of the war the He-177 Greif, intended to be the Luftwaffes maritime patrol plane, was only entering flight testing and was not ready for serial production. Secondly, the Luftwaffe simply did not have a plane capable of flying long distances to locate and intercept British sea convoys. And finally, work already was in progress on a Japanese order to create a maritime patrol plane based on the FW-200 (FW-200 V10).\nAs the result of all that a decision was made to create a long-range maritime patrol plane based on the FW-200 with the same requirements as the He-177. FW-200C differed from its civilian variant mainly by having the under-fuselage gondola with defensive armament. Engine nacelles were enlarged, and each gear wheel was doubled to allow for more reliable take-offs and landings. FW-200C-3 entered service in the summer of 1941. It differed from the initial FW-200C by having a strengthened fuselage construction, as well as the new BMW-Bramo Fafnir 323R-2 engines. The front gunner position was replaced with a hydraulically operated FW-19 turret; in addition to that two waist gunner positions were added. \n\nMain Variants:\nFW-200C-3 BMW-Bramo Fafnir 323R-2 engines, FW-19 turret with MG-15 in the front fuselage, two more MG-15s in waist positions. \nFW-200C-3/U1 MG-FF replaced with a 20-mm MG-151/20 cannon in the nose gondola, FW-19 turret replaced with HDL-151 with MG-151/15 cannon. \nFW-200C-3/U2 FW-19 turret with a MG-15 in front fuselage, due to Lofte-7D bomb sight installation a MG-151/20 in front gondola position replaced with a 13-mm MG-131 machine gun. \nFW-200C-3/U3 FW-19 turret replaced with a EDL-131 with 13-mm MG-131machine gun, another MG-131 replaced a MG-15 in the top rear gunner position. \nFW-200C-3/U-4  crew of seven, EDL-131 replaced by FW-19 with a 13-mm MG-131 machine gun, increased fuel capacity.\n\nAdvantages:\nLong range\n\nDisadvantages:\nLow top speed\nLight bomb load\nInsufficient durability\n\n\n

The new spec inexplicably called for great increase in range and speed compared to the G3M, while retaining most other basic characteristics. It was clear that the only way to achieve this was to considerably lighten the aircraft structure. This was to prove fatal later in the war, as the giant unprotected wing fuel tanks made the aircraft extremely combustible. Protecting the fuel tanks would cause a very large increase in fuel capacity and endurance, which the Navy vehemently opposed.\nBetty first flew in October of 1939, and formally entered service in April of 1941. It went through several modifications throughout the war. Even though its extremely vulnerability became obvious very early, few provisions were made to rectify this, and even at the very end of the war the majority of Bettys in service were just as vulnerable as the initial versions\n\nMain Variants:\nG4M1-11 - Initial production version. 1,530 HP Mitsubishi MK4A engines\nG4M2-22  1,800 HP Mitsubishi MK4P Kaisei engines. Dorsal blister replaced with a turret. Increased tailplane area\nG4M3-34  proposed transport and anti-submarine variant. 1,825 HP MK4T-B Ru Kaisei 25b Ru engines.\n\n\nCombat Service:\nFirst operational missions were flown by Betties in May of 1941 over Chungking and Chengtu in South-East China. On the first day of the war with US it participated in attacks on Clark and Nichols fields in the Philippines. Within a week they sank the British battleship HMS Prince of Wales as well as HMS Repulse.\nBettys service later in the war was to be much less glamorous, as their vulnerability to gunfire was to become its downfall. Its final famous mission was to carry Admiral Yamamoto on a mission when he was intercepted and shot down by US P-38 fighters.\n\n\n\n\n\n

The Freccia was exported to Finland (9 G.50 Serie I, 26 G.50bis) and Croatia (5 G.50bis). Finland bought 25 CMASA manufactured G.50s on October 23rd 1939 and 10 more on January 31st 1940. The plane was fairly expensive considering its performance and equipment, but the main reason for buying a Fiat G.50 was its immediate delivery.\n\nThe aircraft were transported by train via Germany to Sweden for assembly. Only 2 planes had arrived when others were halted in Germany and sent back to Italy because of objections made by the Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Planes traveled through France to Antwerp by rail and then to Norway by ship, until they arrived to Sweden. The last 10 planes were shipped to Sweden through Gibraltar.\n\nThe aircraft were assembled in Malm\u00F6, Torslanda and Trollh\u00E4ttan in Sweden. The first arrived in Finland on December 18th 1939 and the last by June 19th 1940. \n\nThe Fiat G.50 was considered stable and easy to fly. Fiats claimed  88 kills during the Continuation War, while only two planes were lost in combat and one in A-A fire.

They both evolved out of a previous design, and the modifications were rather minor. CR.42 was a further development of the CR.32 which proved itself during the Spanish civil war.  The main new feature of the CR.42 was the new 840 HP Fiat A.74 RIC38 air cooled engine. \nBy 1939 it was quite obvious that bi-plane designs were obsolete. However RA planners thought differently, and their decisions were heavily influenced by their experience in Spain. When Italy entered the war in 1940, 332 CR.42s were employed by the Italian air force. Falco became the most produced Italian fighter, with 1,781 built. In addition to Italy, CR.42s were used by Hungary (50 planes), Sweden (71 planes designated J-11) and Belgium (34 aircraft)\n\n\nMain Variants:\nCR.42  base model with the Fiat A.74 RIC38 engine and 12,7mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns.\nCR.42bis  two additional 12.7mm Breda-SAFAT MGs in under wing gondolas\nCR.42AS  desert variant intended for the African theater\n\nAdvantages:\nHighly maneuverable \nStrong rugged designs which allowed any maneuvers to be performed\n\nDisadvantages:\nObsolete biplane design\nLow top speed\nInsufficient armament\n\n\n

They were one of the pioneers in the field, and their previous examples were generally not capable of combat service.\nThe work on the H IX project began in early 1943. This was in many ways a development on the H VII project; the latter was equipped with twin Argus As-10C piston engines while the new project was to be equipped with twin Jumo 109-004 jets. After the H IX project was personally presented to Goering for approval in late August of 1943, the plane was designated 8-229.\nFirst prototype, without engines, was taken to the skies on March 1st 1944. On June 26th of the same year the work began on the second prototype, equipped with twin jet engines. Unconfirmed sources claim that H IX V2 first flew on December 18th 1944, however February 2nd 1945 is generally considered a more reliable date.\nA test flight on February 18th of 1945 ended in a crash. Right engine flamed out on landing, and the landing gear was dropped prematurely. Pilot attempted to gain speed without raising gear which led to excess power on the left side. The prototype spun out and crashed.\nDespite the accident the work continued. Third prototype received a slightly different shape; ejection seat was planned. Four 30mm MK 108 cannons with 90 shells per gun were also planned; alternatively long barreled MK-103s with 170 shells/gun could be used.\nIn theory the planes construction of metal tube framework covered with plywood was supposed to allow for quick and easy production in small workshops. However in reality building the plane was an incredibly complex affair. To keep the plane centered, a ballast was to be placed in the front fuselage; it was later to be replaced with an armored cockpit.\nThe Gotha company was tasked with producing H Ixs, and planes produced by them would be designated Go-229. The factory however was less than enthusiastic. By the time the Gotha factory was captured by the Americans the H IX V3 was 90% complete, V4 and V5 fuselages were in different stages of completion, and there were enough of other miscellaneous components made to fit about 20 airframes. At this time a disassembled H IX V3 is in storage in a Maryland facility of the Smithsonian; there are plans to fully restore it. \n\nMain Variants:\nH IX V1  test bed without engines\nH IX V2  Prototype with twin Jumo 109-004s\nH IX V3  Unfinished prototype which was to become the basis for the Ho-229A/Go-229A series. \nX IXB  two-seater interceptor project\n\nAdvantages:\nHigh celing\nHigh airspeed and climb rate\nPowerful armament\n\nDisadvantages:\nLow stability\nPoor maneuverability\nPoor pilot visibility from the cockpit\nCramped cockpit\nComplicated landings\nLarge for a fighter\n\n\n

It was also their largest. It was based on a 1940 requirement to obtain 30% higher speed and 50% longer range than Kawanishis previous flying boat, the H6K Mavis. \nThe design path was not easy. Kawanishi encountered problems with stability on water, porpoising and problems taking off. Production was finally authorized in late 1941. A total of 167 were produced during the war. \n\nMain Variants:\nH8K1: Initial production version. 17 built\nH8K2: 1,850 HP Mitsubishi MK4Q Kasei 22 engines\nH8K2-L: Transport version, utilized by the Navy transport units\nH8K3: Prototypes of higher-speed variant with retractable floats.\n\n\nCombat Record:The Emily served in a multitude of roles in the Pacific. It performed transport, reconnaissance and bombing missions, torpedo attacks and long-range patrol. It was also tried in a long-range maritime bomber role against Hawaii and Midway islands, however that proved a failure. However in other roles the Emily was quite successful, due to its high speed, armor and fuel protection, and heavy defensive armament.\n\n\n\n\n\n
He-111H-2         \n    He-111H-2, 1940 model\n\nType: Medium Bomber \n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 8,680 kg.\n    Take-off: 14,000 kg.\n\nLength: 16.4 m.\nWingspan: 22.6 m.\nWing area: 87.5 sq. m.\n\nEngine: 2xJunkers Jumo211A-3.\nPower: 1,100 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level:  360 km/h.\n    At 6,000 m: 405 km/h.\n\nClimb to 2,000 m: 8.5 min.\nService ceiling: 8,000 m.\nRange: 2,000 km.\n\nArmament:\n    5x7.92 mm (MG 15).\n    Bombs of different weight weighing under 2,000 kg.\n\n\nCreated initially as a high-speed civil airliner, the He-111 served as the basis for creating the most common mass-produced German medium bomber at the beginning of the Second World War.\n\nWhen the Third Reich was established, serious steps were taken to cover up the scale of rearmament in Germany, and one of these was to disguise warplane production as the development of new types of civil aviation equipment. The task of developing a two-seater plane that met the standards of medium bomber construction and aerodynamics, and requirements for 10-seater fast airliners, was given to Heinkel in early 1934. Design work on the new aircraft began in the weeks following receipt of the order and, in February 1935, the He-111 prototype was ready to fly. The aircraft excellent performance characteristics and aerodynamics were proven in flight trials and inspired the creation of a medium bomber based on the prototype. The first military version of the Heinkel He-111, marked He-111A, had two BMW VI engines rated at 750 HP each. After the plane was modified in accordance with military aviation requirements, it turned out that the speed and other technical characteristics had considerably decreased. To enhance aircraft features, the initially installed BMW VI engines were replaced with more powerful Daimler-Benz DB 600 A engines rated at 1,000 HP. The trials held after aircraft modernization displayed excellent flight performance and high speed. After the plane was demonstrated to Luftwaffe representatives, it was adopted and serial production began in the spring of 1936 under the He-111B marking.\n\nHe-111 bombers were first used in the civil war in Spain as part of the Kondor Legion and took part in military operations till the end of the Second World War.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nHe-111A - Prototype. Engines: BMW VI, power 750 HP. Armament: 5x7.92 mm (MG 15); total bomb load up to 1,000 kg.\nHe-111B - Serial version. Engines: DB 600 A, power 1,000 HP (later DB 600 C). Armament: no changes made.\nHe-111C - Reconnaissance aircraft on the base of He-111B.\nHe-111D - Serial version. Engines: DB 600 G, power 1,050 HP Armament: no changes.\nHe-111F - Serial version.

Under fuselage machine-gun mounting replaced with central gondola in which a rear gunner was lying. Armament: no changes. Bomb load up to 2,000 kg.\nHe-111H - The most common mass-produced serial modification. A large number of sub-modifications were produced that differed in engines and arming (several weapon variants). \n\nAdvantages: High flight characteristics. Good field of vision from the cockpit. Multifunctional. Good range.\n\nDisadvantages: Low speed. Low service ceiling.\n
He-111H-6         \n    He-111H-6, 1940 model\n\nType: Medium Bomber / Torpedo bomber\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: ~8,700 kg\n    Take-off: ~16,000 kg\n\nLength: 16.4 m\nWingspan: 22.6 m\nWing area: 87.5 sq m\n\nEngine: 2 x Junkers Jumo211F-1\nPower: 1,350 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level:  ~380 km/h\n    At 6,000 m: ~410 km/h\nClimb to 2,000 m: 8.0-10 min\nService ceiling: ~8,700 m\nRange: ~2,500 km\n\nArmament:\n    5 x 7.92 mm (MG 15)\n    1 x 20 mm (MG/FF)\n    Bombs or 2 torpedoes of different weight weighing under 2,000 kg on external pylons.\n\nFrom the beginning of development, the He-111H-6 was designed as a torpedo bomber. The main differences between the He-111H-6 and the  H-2 model were:\n- an additional fuel tank was placed in the internal bomb bay to increase the range; \n- new, more powerful Junkers Jumo211F-1engines were installed;\n- a nose-mounted 20 mm MG/FF cannon was installed instead of a 7.92 mm MG 15;\n- some aircraft in the series had an additional fixed and rearward-firing 7.92 mm MG (MG 15) installed;\n- new bomb/torpedo racks were installed.\n\nAdvantages: High flight characteristics. Good field of vision from the cockpit. Multifunctional. Good range.\n\nDisadvantages: Low speed. Low service ceiling.\n\n\n\n
He-111Z           \n    He-111Z Zwilling, 1942 model\n\nType: Glider Tug \n\nWeight:\n    Take-off: up to 28,500 kg.\n\nLength: 16.4 m.\nWingspan: 35.4 m.\nWing area: 147.6 sq. m.\n\nEngine: 5xJunkers Jumo211 F-2.\nPower: 1,350 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 330 km/h.\n    At 6,000 m: 400 km/h.\n\nService ceiling: 8000 m.\nRange: 4,000 km.\n\nArmament:\n    1x20 mm (MG FF).\n    5x7.92 mm (MG 15).\n    2x13 mm (MG 131).\n\nThe super-power He-111Z (Z - Zwilling (Twins)) aircraft was created in 1941 specially for towing Me-321 and Go-242 gliders.\n\nThe troika of Bf-110 fighters used for towing the Me-321 glider - Troikaschlepp -turned out to be a very inconvenient and, moreover, dangerous means of towing a huge motorless glider. To improve the situation, it was decided that a special aircraft be created that was capable of lifting the glider up in the air on its own. The development of this aircraft was taken on by Heinkel.\n\nThe concept of the new aircraft involved creating a plane that consisted of two He-111 bombers joined together with a single wing. Work started in early 1941 to create two prototypes of the new aircraft, marked He-111Z Zwilling (Twins), and in mid-autumn of 1941 the prototypes were ready.\n\nThe plane was constructed as follows: two He-111H-6 fuselages were joined together with a straight center-wing section which carried the fifth Jumo-211 F-2 engine. The undercarriage consisted of two pairs of landing gear placed in the fuselages. The pilot sat in the left fuselage and controlled all five engines, with a full set of instruments and equipment and control over the release of the left pair of landing gear. The second pilot, acting as navigator, sat in the right fuselage and had duplicate controls. He could also release the right pair of landing gear. The flight engineer, radio operator and gunner were placed in the left fuselage, and the other flight engineer and gunner were in the right fuselage. The armament of the aircraft consisted of a 20mm MG FF cannon in the front part of the left fuselage, a 7.92mm MG 15 machine-gun in the front part of the right fuselage, MG 15 machine-guns placed in the tail part of each lower gondola, two MG 15 machine-guns  in side windows and a 13mm MG 131 machine-gun in the upper center part of each fuselage.\n\nThe Me-321 used a double tow that was fastened to the center section of the inner wing; the Go-242 glider, with less carrying capacity, used a single tow, capable of towing two such gliders simultaneously.\n\nBy the end of autumn 1941, the He-111Z-V1 and He-111Z-V2 prototypes were successfully tested, giving excellent results. Heinkel was ordered to put the 10 He-111Z aircraft into production. This was done by the end of spring 1942.The He-111Z was used for the most part on the Eastern front and in the Crimea to organize the Kuban bridge.\n\nAdvantages: A unique super-power aircraft of its kind. Strong armament.\n\nDisadvantages: More difficult flight control than the regular He-111.\n
He-162A-2         \n    He-162  Salamander \n\nType: Jet Fighter\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 1,664 kg\n    Take-off: 2,800 kg\n\nLength: 9.05m\nWingspan: 7.20m\nWing area: 11.10 sq.m.\n\nEngine: BMW-003E-1 \nPower: rated at 9,02 kN thrust\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 890 km/h\n    At 6,000m: 905 km/h\n\nClimb to 1405 m: 1min.\nService ceiling: 12,300m\nRange: 940 km\n\nArmament:\n    2x20mm (MG 151) cannon\n\nThe idea of creating a so-called peoples fighter (Volksjaeger) - a simple and cheap fighter that could be produced in large quantities from cheap materials and controlled by under qualified personnel - dates back to 1944. The plan was to develop a fighter that would weigh under 2,000 kg, come with two 30-mm cannons, have a flight time of not less than 30 minutes and a take-off runway not exceeding 500m in length. The aircraft was to be equipped with the BMW-003 turbojet engine.\n\nPreliminary design orders were given to all large aircraft constructing companies in Germany: Messerschmitt, Fokke-Wulf, Junkers, Blohm und Voss, Heinkel and Arado. After a number of conferences, a Heinkel project that went by the name of  Spatz (sparrow) was chosen as the peoples fighter. It was marked He-162,  Salamander.\n\nThe most striking features of the He-162 were its small wingspan-to-length ratio, its engine mounting aft of the cockpit and its V-like tail assembly. The engine mounting on top of the fuselage was necessary to prevent problems related to air intake and the nozzle of the turbojet engine. The aircraft's vertical stabilizer was separated into a twin tail fin to remove it from the effective zone of jet exhaust. The He-162 had a simple metal monocoque fuselage made of light alloy and came with a wooden forward cone. Its non-detachable wooden wing with metal tips had plywood skinning. There were a large number of standard units and sets in the cockpit, a few essential devices and an ejection seat fired with a pyro-patrons.\n\nAfter successful trials, and subsequent improvements, serial production of the aircraft was launched and it was constantly undergoing improvements and modifications.\n\nThe Salamanders intended tactical use was to engage bombing escorts, thereby exposing the bombers to Me-262 attacks. Although the He-162 was created to be an easily-controlled fighter, it was by no means a plane for novices. The upper engine mounting caused insufficient aircraft pitch stability and required accurate and precise flying from the pilot.\n\nAdvantages: The fastest fighter of the Second World War. Excellent performance characteristics. Good maneuverability and strong armament. Absolute superiority in speed over all propeller-driven fighters of that time. Good field of vision from the cockpit, except to the rear. Ability to outfly any pursuer.\n\nDisadvantages: The first serial aircraft had defects related for the most part to the gluing of the wooden wing construction. Rather high sensitivity to aircraft control.\n
He-162C           \n    He-162C, 1941\n\nType: \n\nWeight:\n Empty: 1,664 kg\n Take-off: 2,800 kg\n\nLength: 9.5 m\nWingspan: 8 m\nWing area: 12.3 sq m\n\nEngine: 1 x Heinkel-Hirth 011A turbojet\nPower: 1,300 kg/s\n\nTop speed:\n At 6,000 m: 905 km/h\n\nArmament:\n 2 x 30mm MK-108 cannon (100 shells each)\n\nIn the final months of the war, the Heinkel team responsible for the Volksjaeger project came up with many radical redesigns of the 162, all of which were intended to enter service sometime in 1946. They even included such interesting ideas as a pulse jet-powered single-use piloted rocket.\n\nSome of the more viable designs included the He-162B  a refined He-162A, powered by Heinkel-Hirth 011A turbojet, and with airframe improvements intended to increase the planes range and endurance. The proposed C variant was to be a He-162B with a wholly redesigned swept-back wing, and a V-tail assembly. Finally, the D variant would improve on the C by utilizing an entirely novel forward-swept wing, which promised to improve low-speed handling, while also improving high-speed characteristics. \n\nNeither prototype entered production; however a prototype fuselage and two interchangeable sets of wings were captured by the Allies. \n\nMain Variants:\nHe-162A-0 - initial pre-production variant.\nHe-162A-1 - 2 x 30mm MK 108 cannon.\nHe-162A-2 - 2 x 20mm MG 151/20 cannon.\nHe-162A-3 - 2 x 30mm MK 108 cannon (project).\nHe-162A-8 - Jumo 004D-4 engine (project).\nHe-162B-1 - Heinkel-Hirth 011A turbojet, redesigned fuselage and wings, 2 x 30 mm MK 108 cannon (project).\nHe-162C - He-162B with swept wings, and a V-tail (project).\nHe-162D - He-162C with a forward-swept wing (project).\nHe-162E - He 162A with powered by the BMW 003A turbojet with a BMW 718 liquid-fuel rocket (project).\nHe-162S - two-seat glider intended as a trainer.\n\nAdvantages:\nPromised good performance\nStrong armament\nCheap and easy to produce\n\nDisadvantages:\nNever entered production\n\n\n

It had to be fairly small and use two low-powered engines. It was anticipated that the two-engine scheme and small dimensions would give it a greater chance of surviving enemy anti-aircraft fire. Furthermore, the use of 75mm armor glasses and pilot and engine armor protection were provided for. The armament was to consist of at least two 20mm MG FF cannons and machine-guns. On October 1 1937, design projects were presented by Focke-Wulf and Henschel. The Henschel project was chosen as best representing a fully-fledged attack plane. There followed an order to develop a prototype, designated Hs-129.\n\nAt the beginning of 1939, the Hs 129V-1 prototype - constructed by the chief Henschel designer, Friedrich Nickolaus - made its first flight. The aircraft was a small low-wing monoplane equipped with two air-cooled Argus 410 engines rated at 465 HP. The single-seater cockpit was welded from armor plates which were 6 to 12 mm thick. The aircraft armament consisted of two 20mm MG 151/20 cannons and two 7.92mm MG-17 machine-guns installed at the sides of the cabin. \n\nThe results of the army's trials were unsatisfactory. The engines installed did not ensure sufficient power and control of the plane called for great strain and effort. To make things worse, the cockpit was rather cramped and did not provide adequate field of vision. Nevertheless, serial production began because of the desperate need for attack aircraft.\n\nThe serial aircraft was marked Hs-129B-1 and was now equipped with more powerful French Gnome-Rhone 14M 4/5 engines, rated at 740 HP each at take-off, replacing the Argus 410 engines. The canopy was also modified. The serial version had better flight characteristics, but its controls were still far from perfect. The 129B-1 carried versatile armament including various combinations of bombs intended to strike well-armored enemy weapons and equipment.\n\nFrom the end of 1942, the Red Army started using an ever-increasing number of well-armored KV and T-34 tanks on all fronts. These were able to resist the insufficient armaments of the Hs-129B-1. To respond to this shortcoming, a new attack plane modification was developed in early 1943 - the Hs-129B-2 -  which was constructed in the same way but had better armament. Four main Hs- 129V-2 sub-modifications with different armament variants were produced:\n\nHs-129B-2/R1 - Two 13mm MG 131 machine-guns; two 20mm MG 151/20 cannons;\nHs-129B-2/R2 - Two 7.92mm MG-17 machine-guns; two 20mm MG-151/20 cannons; 1 30mm MK 101 cannon suspended beneath the fuselage;\nHs-129B-2/R3 - Four 13mm MG 131 machine-guns;\nHs-129B-2/R4 - Two 13mm MG 131 machine-guns; Two 20mm MG-151/20 guns; bomb rack under the fuselage for 4x50kg bombs or one 250 kg bomb.\nHs-129B-2/Wa - Two 20mm MG-151/20 cannons; 1 37mm BK 3.7 cannon, placed in gondola beneath the fuselage.\n\nThe Hs-129B-2 was used till the end of World War II, mainly on the Eastern front against armored objects and vehicles.\n\nAdvantages: Strong armor.

Hs-129B-3/Wa      \n    Hs-129B-3/Wa Waffentraeger, 1944 model\n\nType: Ground Attack \n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 3,810 kg.\n    Take-off: 5,250 kg.\n\nLength: 9.75 m.\nWingspan: 14.20 m.\nWing area: 29 sq.m.\n\nEngine: 2xGnome-Rhone 14M 4/5.\nPower: 740 HP\n\nSpeed \n   Sea level: 330 km/h\n   At 3,350 m:  380 km/h.\n\nService ceiling: 5,000 m.\nRange: 688 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x20 mm (MG-151/20).\n    1x75 mm (BK 7.5): suspension type.\n\nBy the beginning of 1944, attack aircraft urgently needed guns of larger caliber than the 30 or 37mm ones used on the Hs-129B-2 attack plane. The Hs-129B-2/Wa with 37mm cannon had proved highly effective in destroying armored targets, but with the increasingly large-scale introduction of better-armored enemy weapons and equipment its firing capacity was becoming insufficient.\n\nIn June 1944, a new Hs-129 attack plane model was developed. It was initially marked Hs-129B-3. The Hs-129B-3 was equipped with a 75mm BK 7.5 cannon, a modified version of the field PAK 40 - PAK-40L (Panzer Abwehr Kanone = Anti-Tank Gun, L= Luft) gun. Instead of a mechanical recoil mechanism, the BK 7.5 came with an electro-pneumatic recoil mechanism; in addition, the gun had a powerful dual brake. The gun was approximately 6 meters long, and the recoil effect made it move up to a meter back. The BK 7.5 armament consisted of 12 shells weighing 11.8kg each and the intervals between shots was 1.5 seconds. The gun was mounted beneath the fuselage gondola and could be dropped in-flight, allowing the pilot to maintain control of the aircraft if one of the engines was damaged or increase airspeed by cutting down the overall weight of the aircraft.\n\nThe first three Hs-129B-3 prototypes were tested in August-September 1944 in Tarnovitse. The tests, which involved shooting at captured Soviet tanks, were successful and an order was given for industrial production of the Hs-129B-3 attack planes, to be marked Hs-129B-3/Wa Waffentraeger (Weapons carrier). To prevent overload and deterioration of flight characteristics, the new attack planes were produced without two 7.92mm MG-17 machine-guns.\n\nAbout 25 Hs-129B-3/Wa  attack planes were assembled at a factory in Schenefield. They were shipped to military units in winter 1944-45 and were successfully used against all types of enemy armored equipment, including heavy IS-2 tanks.\n\nAdvantages: Strong cockpit armor. High firing capacity. Capable of destroying any type of armored target.\n\nDisadvantages: Cramped cockpit. Unstable operation of the engines in dusty air. Heavy control in flight. Unsatisfactory field of vision from the cockpit.\n

P-11F and P.Z.L. P-24E fighters produced under license and adopted by Romania were undoubtedly becoming outdated because of their flight characteristics and armament. They simply did not meet modern standards set for this kind of plane. To remedy this situation, the Romanians decided to create their own fighter. To cut the costs of development and further serial production, the plane was supposed to make maximum use of certain sets and parts from Polish P.Z.L. P-11F and P.Z.L. P-24E aircraft.\n\nThe I.A.R. 80 prototype was constructed in April 1939. The aircraft was based mainly on the Romanian version of the Polish P-24E fighter, using the same engine and various other parts. The initial armament of the aircraft consisted of two 7.62mm Browning FN machine-guns and it was supposed to use 4 such machine-guns for industrial production. Flight trials revealed a number of imperfections, which they planned to eliminate before going into serial production. In the course of modernization, a more powerful I.A.R. K 14-III C36 engine was installed. The fuselage was increased in length to compensate for a new, heavier engine. The fuel tank capacity was increased to 455 l.\n\nThe serial issue of the I.A.R. 80 had to be suspended because of the outbreak of the Second World War and the occupation of France where most of the parts required for the aircraft construction were produced. Apart from that, some parts for I.A.R. 80 production were shipped from Germany and, when the war began, Germany stopped all supplies to Romania and used its own material and technical resources to construct military equipment. Serial production of the I.A.R. 80 was resumed only in November 1940 when Romania became Nazi Germanys ally.\n\nThe Romanian designers used the period when serial production of the I.A.R. 80 was suspended to develop a new, more powerful engine, the I.A.R. K.14-1000A (power 1,025 HP), which after renewal of serial production was installed on all I.A.R. 80 aircraft.\n\nI.A.R. 80 fighters were used throughout the Second World War. They took part in battles on the territory of Moldavia, in southern Ukraine and in Stalingrad, as well as being used to defend Romania against Allied aviation raids. From September 1944, they were used against the Germans in Hungary.\n\nIn 1950, a number of I.A.R. 80 aircraft were remade into training aircraft marked I.A.R. 80 DC.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nI.A.R. 80 - Armament: 4 Browning 7.62mm FN machine-guns.\nI.A.R. 80A - Armament: 6 Browning 7.62mm FN machine-guns; Bombs of different weight under 100 kg.\nI.A.R. 80B - Armament: 4 Browning 7.62mm FN machine-guns and two 13mm MG 131 machine-guns.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent performance characteristics of the aircraft. Very high maneuverability and strong armament in the gun-equipped variant. Good field of vision from the cockpit. Simple controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Low maximum speed.\n

At the time, Romania was using the Polish P.Z.L. P-24E aircraft as bombers and they were hopelessly outdated and unfit for conducting modern military operations. One of the ways out of the situation was to order Ju-87 dive-bombers from Germany, but this idea did not work because all the planes produced were sent to the German air force.\n\nThe unsuccessful attempts to order Ju-87 planes were followed by a decision to create their own bomber, based on the serially produced I.A.R. 80 fighter. When modified as a bomber, the I.A.R. 80 was marked I.A.R. 81.\n\nThe I.A.R. 81 was constructed along the lines of a dive-bomber. The aircraft came with the same engine as before: an I.A.R. K.14-1000A with 1,025 HP. The front part of the fuselage was enlarged. Pilot armor was introduced. The armament consisted of 6 Browning 7.62mm FN machine-guns. The plane had a bomb rack under the fuselage that was suited for dive-bombing.\nMost of the planes produced had one 250 kg bomb placed under the fuselage, while a few came with four 50 kg bombs under the wings.\n\nThe I.A.R. 81 bombers shipped to military units gradually started to replace the outdated P.Z.L. P-24E.The I.A.R. 81 aircraft took part in the battles for Stalingrad and provided air cover in Budapest. From September 1944, the I.A.R. 81 - modernized back into fighters - was used against the Germans in Hungary.\n\nAbout 461 I.A.R. 80 and I.A.R. 81 aircraft of all modifications were produced.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nI.A.R.81 - Dive-bomber. Armament: 6 Browning 7.62mm FN machine-guns. Bombs: one 250 kg beneath the fuselage and four 50 kg bombs under both wings.\nI.A.R.81A -  Dive-bomber. Armament: 4 Browning 7.62mm FN machine-guns and 2 13mm MG 131 machine-guns. Bombs: same as above.\nI.A.R.81B - Dive-bomber. Armament: 4 Browning 7.62mm FN machine-guns and two 20mm MG FF cannons. Bombs: no change. Two mountings for additional drop tanks.\nI.A.R.81C - Fighter-bomber. Armament: 4 Browning 7.62mm FN machine-guns and 2 20mm MG-151 cannons. Bombs: same configuration.\n\nAdvantages: Good flight performance. High maneuverability and strong armament in the cannon-equipped version. Good field of vision from the cockpit. Simple and easily understood controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Low maximum speed.\n

Until then, defense of land masses was relegated to the Army.\nThe Navy ordered Mitsubishi to build its first interceptor in February of 1942. The first prototype, designated J2M1, suffered from many problems, including very poor view over the large engine, problems with landing gear, and faulty power plant. The version was cancelled after only three were built.\nThe subsequent production models kept suffering from various problems, and the general confusion with constant revisions and modifications finally caused the production to cease.\n\nMain Variants:\nJ2M1  initial variant.

B-29 raids were becoming much more of a problem, and the existing variants of the Raiden left much to be desired when intercepting the Superfortress at altitude. \n\nThe first high-altitude attempt, the J2M4, was powered by a turbo supercharged MK4R-C Kasei 23c engine and equipped with an exhaust turbine. The supercharger allowed the plane to stay at full power above 9,000 meters, as opposed to only 4,800 meters for the J2M3. Unfortunately, the supercharger design was troublesome, and was never perfected enough to enter serial production. Only two J2M4s were built, never going beyond the initial tests.\n\nMitsubishi then tried the MK4U-A Kasei 26a engine with a three-stage supercharger. The new variant, designated J2M5 and officially known as the Mitsubishi Intercepting Fighter Raiden Model 33, was much more successful. It had excellent climb rate, and was also the fastest version of the Raiden.\n\nBy the time the trials were over, the overall situation had become critical. Japanese Navy needed modern fighters to fight off the B-29s, but they could not be built fast enough as those same B-29s were destroying the Japanese manufacturing capacity. Between May 1944 and the end of the war only 34 Raiden Model 33s were built and delivered to front-line units.\n\nMain Variants:\nJ2M5  initial version with 2 x 20mm cannons\nJ2M5 Otsu  J2M5 with 4 x 20mm cannons\n\nAdvantages:\nHigh Speed\nGood performance at all altitudes\nPowerful Armament\n\nDisadvantages:\nPoor rearward visibility\nLow Ammunition\n\n\n
Ju-52/3mg4e       \n    Ju-52/3mg7e, 1939 model\n\nType: Transport/Light Bomber \n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 6,560 kg.\n    Take-off: 11,050 kg.\n\nLength: 18.80 m.\nWingspan: 29.25 m.\nWing area: 110.50 sq. m.\n\nEngine: 3xBMW 132T.\nPower: 830 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 295 km/h.\n    At 1,400 m: 305 km/h.\n\nClimb time to 3,000 m: 19 min.\nService ceiling: 5,490 m.\nRange: 1,500 km.\n\nArmament:\n    1x13 mm (MG 131).\n    1x7.92 mm (MG 15).\n\nThe history of the Ju-52/3mg transport aircraft started with the creation of the worlds first all-metal Junkers J.1 aircraft, produced in 1915.\n\nThe Ju-52 prototype was designed in 1930. The new aircraft was a further consistent development of the Junkers J.1 aircraft. The Ju-52 was initially a one-engine plane, featuring a double wing with flaps covering the whole rear part of the wing. The fuselage was made of steel pipes and paneled with corrugated aluminum sheets ensuring considerably higher durability. On the right side of the fuselage, there was a cargo door that opened horizontally.\n\nThe first six Ju-52 aircraft came with only one engine. The constructed aircraft had good flight characteristics and could be used by under qualified pilots. Its low landing speed meant it could use small airdromes. The well-thought-out fuselage construction made it possible to use the aircraft for cargo operations with maximum effectiveness. However, although its performance was good, the aircraft was not cost-effective and one engine could not ensure sufficient carrying capacity. Taking this into consideration, it was decided to remake the  Ju-52 as a three-engine aircraft, without making extensive modifications to its construction.\n\nThe first three-engine Ju-52 aircraft, called the Ju-52/3m, was produced in 1931. The aircraft was equipped with three Pratt & Whitney Hornet engines (later BMW 132T) and could transport 17 passengers in addition to its 2-man crew. Serial production of the plane started after flight tests and German demonstrations, and it was used to export supplies to many countries throughout the world.\n\nThe planes reliability and simple maintenance inspired further Ju-52/3m development, but now for military purposes. Marked as Ju-52/3mg3e, the aircraft was modernized for use as a heavy bomber. The plane had a 4-man crew. Armament consisted of two 7.92mm MG 15 machine-guns (one placed in the upper part of the fuselage, the other in a retractable metal turret in the lower part of the fuselage behind the landing gear).\n\nThe first combat test for the Ju-52/3m was the civil war in Spain where Ju-52/3m aircraft were sent as part of the Kondor Legion. They were used there till summer 1937 to attack infantry, ports and towns, including Madrid. The war in Spain was the last time the Ju-52/3m was used as a fully-fledged bomber; it entered the Second World War mostly as a Luftwaffe transport aircraft and was used on all fronts till the last days of the war. Throughout World War II, the Ju-52/3m aircraft were very seldom used as bombers and could be used for this purpose only when complete air superiority was guaranteed.\n\nIn the course of serial production, a large number of Ju-52/3m modifications were produced that involved, for the most part, changes in armament, equipment and minor modernization of the aircraft construction. About 4,540 Ju-52/3m planes of all modifications were produced from 1931. After the war, the Ju-52/3m was built in France and Spain. A number of these planes were used by the Swiss Air Force.\n\nAdvantages: Good flight abilities. Multifunctional. Reliable. Simple controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Weak armament. Slow speed.\n
Ju-87B-2          \n    Ju-87B-2  Stuka, 1941 model\n\nType: Dive Bomber \n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 2,750 kg.\n    Take-off: 4,340 kg.\n\nLength: 11.1 m.\nWingspan: 13.8 m.\nWing area: 31.9 sq.m.\n\nEngine: 1xJumo 211D.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 970 HP\n    Take-off: 1,200 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 338 km/h.\n    At 4,400 m: 380 km/h.\n\nClimb to 5,000m: 12 min.\nService ceiling: 8,100 m.\nRange: 800 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.92 mm (MG 17): in the wing.\n    1x7.92 mm (MG 15).\n    Bombs: 1x500 kg or 1x250 kg + 4x50 kg.\n\nThe Ju-87 dive-bomber (Sturzkampfflugzeug - Stuka) was created in response to a competitive challenge to develop a two-seater dive-bomber made by the German Ministry of Aviation (RLM) in 1933. The Ju-87 performed well in selective trials and came out on top, despite the fact that it was competing against aircraft designs by Arado, Heinkel and Blohm und Voss.\n\nThe Ju-87 prototype was an attack Junkers K-47 fighter plane produced for Germany by a Junkers subsidiary - the Swedish company AB Flugindustrie. The first Ju-87 V1 prototype flew in September 1935. The plane was designed by Herman Polman. It was an all-metal plane with twin tail fin and wings of two-spar construction. The center-wing section formed a single whole with the fuselage and a typical W-shaped curve. The aircraft was equipped with a Rolls-Royce Kestrel-V engine rated 525 HP at take-off.\n\nThe Ju-87 V1 was followed by more prototypes which differed from the first model in the installation of a German Junkers Ju-210A engine, rated at 640 HP, and a single tail unit. The planes came with a special dive-bombing gun sight. Bomb-dropping tests were carried out with under fuselage aviation bombs ranging from 100 to 500 kg.\n\nOn the whole, the aircraft was very solid and reliable, combining excellent response to control with fairly good field of vision and sufficient maneuverability for this type of aircraft. In dive-bombing operations, bomb deviation did not exceed 30m from the target.\n\nThe Ju-87 bomber was adopted at the beginning of 1937 and the went into large-scale serial production. The first pilot series of the Ju-87 A-0 Anton consisted of 10 aircraft; it was followed by a mass-produced series of Ju-87 A-1 aircraft.\n\nAt the end of 1937, the Ju-87 A-2 modification was developed. Planes of this modification were equipped with a new Ju-210D engine (rated 680 HP) and modified communication devices. 262 Ju-87A aircraft were built.\n\nIn use, the Ju-87 A revealed insufficient engine power, a low ceiling and insufficient bomb load and range. All these shortcomings entailed the development of a new modernized version - the Ju-87 B Berta (serial version). The new Ju-87 B-1 modification differed from Ju-87 A in its sliding canopy (the Ju-87 A canopy was opened to the side), reconstructed front fuselage and the fully redesigned front of the engine. Some changes were also introduced to gear fairing, the radio antenna mast and tail unit. The aircraft was armed with a MG 15 machine-gun for the rear gunner and two MG 17 machine-guns on the wing (on the Ju-87 A there was only one). A siren was mounted on one gear strut (later on both struts) to exert psychological pressure on the enemy during attacks. The Ju-87 B-1 was initially equipped with a Ju-211A engine (rated at 1,000 HP), and later with a Ju-211D engine (rated 1,200 HP). Ju-87 B-1 serial production started from November 1938; 808 units of Ju-87 B-1 aircraft were built.\n\nIn December 1939, the next serial modification - the Ju-87 B-2 - started being built. Planes of this modification had water radiators of larger size and new fairings on the wing machine-guns. The metal three-blade air propeller was replaced with a wooden one. Radio equipment was considerably improved. The bomb load with one pilot could go up to 1,000 kg.\n\nJu-87 planes started their combat career in the civil war in Spain and were used throughout World War II on all fronts. \n\nMain modifications:\n\nJu-87 B-2/U1 (U2) - Modernized communication.\nJu-87 B-2/U3 - Additional armor plate for pilot and gunner.\nJu-87 B-2/U4 - Ski landing gear (was not produced serially).\nJu-87 B-2 trop - A variant with additional air filter and other special desert or tropical equipment.\n\nAdditional modifications:\n\nJu-87 C  - Carrier-borne bomber. Further Ju-87 B development. Equipped with special device ensuring take-off from the catapult. Folding wings. \nJu-87 R - Ju-87 B-2 with increased range. It was possible to mount additional drop tanks. Bomb load of up to 250 kg.\n\nAdvantages: Good flight characteristics and aircraft maneuverability. Good field of vision from the cabin. Reliability. Simple and easy controls and maintenance.\n\nDisadvantages: Weak defensive armament.\n
Ju-87D-3          \n    Ju-87D-3  Stuka, 1942 model\n\nType: Dive Bomber \n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 3,900 kg.\n    Take-off: 5,850 kg.\n\nLength: 11.5 m.\nWingspan: 13.8 m.\nWing area: 32.0 sq.m.\n\nEngine: 1xJumo 211J.\nPower: \n    Indicated: 1,100 HP\n    Take off: 1,400 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 334 km/h.\n    At 4,350 m:  382 km/h.\n\nClimb to 5,000 m: 18,5 min.\nService ceiling: 6,500 m.\nRange: 1,500 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x7.92 mm (MG 17): in the wing.\n    2x7.92 mm (MG 81Z).\n    Bombs: 1x1000 kg or 1x500 kg or 1x250 kg + 4x50 kg (or 2x250 kg).\n\nThe experience of using the Ju-87 B aircraft during the Polish campaign led to the creation of a new modification - the Ju-87 D Dora - in 1941. It turned out that the defensive armament of the Ju-87 B, which consisted of only one 7.92mm MG 15 machine-gun, was not at all sufficient, even when engaging Polish P.Z.L. P-11 fighters armed with two machine-guns of the same caliber. It was also necessary to enhance the pilot and rear gunner armor. \n\nIt was anticipated that the new aircraft variant would be equipped with a more powerful engine - the Jumo 211F (rated 1,383 HP) - but in February 1941 it was replaced by the new Jumo 211J engine (rated 1,400 HP) that was installed on the first serial aircraft. In June 1941, production of the new serial Ju-87 D aircraft began at a factory in Bremen-Landwerden. The total order came to 1,037 units.\n\nThe Ju-87 D had an aerodynamically improved front fuselage. Water and oil radiators were now installed in different places. Protective armament was strengthened by installing a twin 7.92mm Mauzer MG 81 Z machine-gun in an armored turret for the rear gunner. Crew armor was strengthened. The pilots seat was almost completely armored with 4mm and 8mm armored plates, a 10mm armored headrest and a 5mm floor. The gunner now also had an armored headrest and side armored plates. The canopy was given a more streamlined form, the fuel system was constructed in the same way as on the Ju-87 R and gear leg fairings were diminished and simplified. Bomb racks also underwent modernization. Maximum bomb load increased to 1,800 kg. The aircraft was equipped with two sirens set on each gear strut. In general, the new  Ju-87 D modification was a better combat aircraft, featuring much better flight characteristics.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nJu-87 D-1 -  The first serial variant of the D modification. Additional cabin armor. Strengthened landing gear.\nJu-87 D-1 trop - A version with an additional air filter and other desert equipment.\nJu-87 D-2 - Planes of the series were intended for towing landing (transport) GO 242 and DFS 230 gliders. Strengthened tail assembly. New tail leg with a towing hook for the glider.\nJu-87 D-3 - Ground attack aircraft. Strengthened armor for the crew, engine and radiator. Aerodynamic sirens were removed.\nJu-87 D-4 - Prototype of land-based torpedo-bomber. The aircraft could carry one 533mm LTF 5B torpedo.\nJu-87 D-5 - Ground attack aircraft. Increased wingspan (15m). Increased bomb load. On-board armament: 2x20 mm (MG 151/20) - in the wing; a 2x7.92 mm (MG 81) - at the rear gunners disposal.\nJu-87 D-6 - Simplified version of Ju-87 D-5 bomber-fighter.

Ju-87G-1          \n    Ju-87G-1  Stuka, 1943 model\n\nType: Ground Attack\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 4,400 kg.\n    Take-off: 6,600 kg.\n\nLength: 11.50 m.\nWingspan: 15.00 m.\nWing area: 33.69 sq.m.\n\nEngine: 1xJumo 211J.\nPower:\n    Indicated: 1,100 HP\n    Take off: 1,400 HP\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level: 320 km/h.\n    At 4,000 m:  340 km/h.\n\nClimb to 5,000 m: 19.8 min.\nService ceiling: 6,500 m.\nRange: 2,000 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x37 mm (BK-3.7): under the fuselage.\n    2x7.92 mm (MG 81Z).\n\nSince the usual bombs were almost totally incapable of destroying tanks, a new modification of the Ju-87 aircraft was created at the beginning of 1943. It was specially geared for tank-killing missions and marked Ju-87 G. Under the fuselage of the serially produced Ju-87 D aircraft, two 37mm BK-3.7 (Flak-18) cannons were installed specifically for anti-tank purposes. The choice was not random because their 37mm shells with tungsten cores could penetrate the armor of most tanks. The gun and magazine were placed in a streamlined container, which was fastened under the wing right behind the gear leg. If it became necessary to use the Ju-87 G as a bomber, the gun mountings could easily be dismantled and replaced with bomb racks.\n\nThis armament variant was tested for the first time on a modernized Ju-87 D-5 version in the summer of 1942. The trials demonstrated that the new aircraft was a more effective anti-tank weapon than many similar Luftwaffe planes such as the Henschel Hs-129 and Junkers Ju-88P. After successful trials were over, it was decided to start serial production of the Ju-87 G in two variants - the Ju-87 G-1 and the Ju-87 G-2. The Ju-87 G-1 aircraft was a remade Ju-87 D-3, and the Ju-87 G-2 was a remade Ju-87 D-5. Both variants had dismantled wing armament. However, some of the Ju-87 G-1 planes still had one wing machine-gun for aiming purposes.\n\nTank-destroying Ju-87 G planes were widely used on the Eastern front, especially in the battles of Kursky Duga. The Ju-87 G-2 was the aircraft flown by the famous German pilot, Hans-Ulrich Rudel - he alone destroyed 519 units of enemy armored vehicles.\n\nFurther modifications:\n\nJu-87 H - Training aircraft with double controls. A remake of the Ju-87 D aircraft. Onboard armament and bomb racks were removed. The cockpit canopy received side blisters to provide better front vision for the instructor.\n\nAdvantages: Good flight characteristics. Easy controls and maintenance. Strong firepower. Good field of vision from the cockpit. Reliable. Multifunctional. Good armor for the crew and power plant. \n\nDisadvantages: Low maneuverability, insufficient speed and defensive armament.\n

Evers and an American, El Gassner, who worked in Europe in 1935-36. The first Ju-88V-1 prototype was a low-wing monoplane with streamlined cockpit canopy and two Daimler-Benz water-cooled DB-600 engines with frontal radiators (rated 900 HP each). The crew consisted of three men. The Ju-88V-1 prototype made its maiden flight in December 1936, but was destroyed during the flight trials.\n\nThe possibility of installing more powerful engines and changing the front fuselage was investigated on further prototypes. The cone-shaped fuselage head was replaced with a fully-glazed section assembled out of 20 flat optical glass panels; the crew was increased to four. An under fuselage gondola was installed on the aircraft and adjusted for the lying gunner who controlled the rear 7.92mm MG 15 machine-gun. In the course of prototype construction, the possibility of using the Ju-88 as a dive-bomber was considered. The plane was supposed to have a defensive armament of three MG 15 machine-guns and the bomb load in the bomb section would reach 500 kg.\n\nAfter thorough flight trials with excellent results, it was decided to put the Ju-88 into serial production in 1937. The Ju-88 aircraft became the production prototype for the A series. It came with Jumo 211B-1 engines (power 1,200 HP). To enable the Ju-88 to be used as a dive-bomber, the plane was equipped with dive brakes placed under the front spar on the outside of the gondolas.\n\nIn the course of serial production of the A series, 17 modifications of the Ju-88A aircraft were produced. They differed in purpose, armament, engines, etc.\n\nThe most common  mass-produced modification of the A series became the Ju-88A-4 aircraft, serial production of which was launched in 1940. It differed from the first production series (A-1) through its larger wingspan, strengthened gear and good armor for the crew. The basic armament consisted of one 7.92mm MG 81 machine-gun placed in the front  fuselage, a 7.92mm MG 81Z machine-gun in the under fuselage gondola and two rear-firing MG 81 machine-guns placed in the aft cockpit. Indicated bomb load - including different bomb combinations placed on under wing racks - came to 1,000 kg.\n\nThe Ju-88A was used throughout the Second World War on all fronts. It served as the basis for creating numerous modifications such as a dive-bomber, a conventional bomber, a torpedo-bomber, a fighter, a night fighter, an attack plane, a reconnaissance aircraft, a communication aircraft, a mine supplier and a radio-controlled flying bomb.\n\nAdvantages: Good flight performance. High maneuverability and good armament. Multifunctional. Excellent field of vision from the cockpit. Functions of auto-diving and bomb dropping.\n\nDisadvantages: Insufficient armament on early serial planes.\n
Ju-88Mistel       \n    Mistel 3a, 1944\n\nType: composite aircraft (FW-190A-8 + Ju-88A-4)\n\nWeight: \n    Empty: 10,725 kg\n    Take-off: 16,000 kg\n\nLength: 14.4 m \nWingspan: 20.0 m\nWing area: 7.44 Sq. M.\n\nEngine: BMW801 and 2 x Jumo 211B-1\n\nTop speed: 433 km/h at sea level\nClimb to 5,000 m: 6.2 min\n\nService ceiling: approx 10,000 m\n\nRange: 1,000 km\n\nArmament:  3,156 kg warhead.\n\nThe Mistel is certainly one of the most unusual aircraft to ever enter combat service. Like so many of the German late-war wonder weapons, the Mistel was an exceptional engineering achievement that holds many records for being the first in its field. While seemingly similar to other countries composite aircraft, the Mistel was completely unique in nature. It wasn't just a few airplanes hooked together, each with its own crew like the Soviet Zveno or the American airship experiments. The Mistel was actually the worlds first stand off weapon, the predecessor of both cruise missiles like today's Tomahawk, and the precision bombs like the JSOW. It was also the worlds first operational fly-by-wire aircraft.\n\nThe German Mistel program started with the tests held in October of 1942. A Bf-109E on top and a DFS-230 glider on the bottom were flown by two human pilots in order to study the aerodynamical properties of composite aircraft. This wasn't intended to be an actual operational design, but rather a test bed for future designs of a similar arrangement. These tests soon produced enough data, and by June of 1943 a report was drafted which called for an operational Bf-109F and a Ju-88 combination. \n\nThe Ju-88 and 109 combination initially proved hard to control. 109s control surfaces were insufficient to pilot both aircraft, and during the aircraft separation the 109 could achieve a very strong nose-up movement, which could potentially lead to the two aircraft colliding. After a series of tests and modifications, a very advanced control system was implemented which moved the bombers controls based on the fighters input. In the end result the Mistel was easier to pilot than either a Bf-109, FW-190 or the Ju-88, and by all pilot accounts it was a pleasure to fly. Other notable feature of the Mistel was its sight and automatic guidance system which was capable of striking the target when released from the distance of 5 kilometers and more. \n\nIn the production model, the Junkers cockpit was replaced with a 3-ton high-explosive warhead which was capable of penetrating up to 8 meters of armored steel and 20 meters of concrete wall. The explosion could literally level city blocks.\n\nWhile many of the early Mistel tests were performed with a Bf-109, most of the production models used a FW-190. However operational Mistels were not flown by fighter pilots; instead bomber pilots were retrained to fly the FW fighter. They were certainly more capable of using the navigational and aiming equipment of the Mistel, but could not be relied on to fight off the enemy fighters after releasing their bomber. \n\nDuring the Mistels trials and early production runs, German high command nursed the idea of using hundreds of Mistels in simultaneous attacks on Soviet industry targets and British ports. The pilots would only have enough fuel to fly one way, and they were supposed to bail out and surrender to the enemy after fulfilling their mission. Detailed plans were created, however by the time first Mistels entered front-line service in the summer of 1944, Allied air superiority was simply too overwhelming to allow for anything like that.\n\nMistels were used operationally against various targets, but most of them never reached their destination. Quite a few were shot down by fighters and flak, and even more were destroyed on the ground. Ultimately, like so many of the German wonder weapons, the Mistel entered service too late to affect the course of the war. Its contribution to the war effort was minimal, however its engineering achievements continue to impress us even today.\n\nMain Variants:\nMistel 1  Ju-88A-4 + Bf 109F-4, summer 1942. \nMistel 2  Ju-88G-1 + FW-190A-8, fall 1944.\nMistel 3a  Ju-88A4 + FW-190A-8, summer 1944.\nMistel 3b -  Ju-88G-1 + FW-190A-8, early 1945.\nMistel 3c  Ju-88G-10 + Fw-190F-8, early 1945.\n\nAdvantages:\nPossibility to convert thousands of obsolete medium bombers into strategic bombers\nLarge destructive power\n\nDisadvantages:\nSingle use weapon\nComplete defenselessness against enemy aircraft\n\n\n

This indigenous Japanese design, the first low-wing monoplane of the Japanese Army, had surprisingly good performance, and was able to meet the latest Soviet warplanes on equal terms. According to Soviet reports, the Ki-27 were flown by very capable airmen who could meet the latest I-16 on equal terms, and were vastly superior to the I-15.\n\nStill built to WWI-style specifications, the Ki-27 was soon to go out of style. With the original design specifications giving strong preference to maneuverability over speed, the Ki-27 was an excellent turn-and-burn fighter, but a slow one at that. In the original design competition, the variant with the largest wing and the lowest wing loading was selected. The plane was virtually impossible to stall in a dogfight. However, its top speed of only 395 kph at ground level, and a 650 HP engine, were to be its death warrant as the War in the Pacific broke out. \n\nAs the war progressed, and the newer faster opponents appeared in the sky, the Ki-27 could not compete. By 1942, as the IJA Ki-27s were meeting P-40s flown by the American Volunteer Group in China, the plane was hopelessly obsolete. Soon after the war started the Ki-27 was being replaced by the Ki-43, and by 1943 the process was complete, with the Ki-27 and variants relegated to training duties. \n\nA total of 3,399 Ki-27s of all variants were built.\n\nMain Variants:\nP.E.  initial prototype. 650 HP Army Type 97 engine\nKi-27 Ko  initial production variant.\nKi-27 Otsu  remodeled canopy with clear vision panels; modified oil cooler; provision for under wing bombs\nKi-27 KAI  light-weight prototype intended to fill the gap caused by the delays of the Ki-43.\nKi-79  two-seater trainer version\n\nAdvantages:\nExcellent maneuverability\n\nDisadvantages:\nLight armament\nLow top speed\nPoor pilot protection\n\n\n

It was to be a replacement for the Ki-27 fighter, and have overall improved performance and flight characteristics. Maneuverability was one of the main requirements, but the Nakajima team realized that they could not meet the performance requirements and still keep Ki-27s maneuverability. Some attempts were made to reduce weight such as trying a fixed landing gear, but the one that finally stuck was the adoption of a butterfly flap which did improve maneuverability significantly, but still the pilots complained about the Hayabusas inferior maneuverability.\nModel 2 production started in 1943. The Ki-43 went through several major improvements, including a new 1,150 engine with a three-blade propeller, redesigned canopy and a reflector gunsight among other things. However Ki-43-II proved ill fitted for dogfights and was more appropriate for bomber intercepts. The final major revision, the Ki-43-III, had a more powerful 1,230 HP engine and introduced other improvements which made it better fit for the changing conditions at the front.\nOverall, the Ki-43 was the most important series of Japanese Army fighters, with almost 6,000 produced. Various sources quote anywhere from 5,751 to 5,919 built. \n\nMain Variants:\nKi-43-Ia: initial variant. 950HP Nakajima Ha-95 engine. Twin 7.7mm machine guns\nKi-43-Ib: same airframe as Ki-43-Ia, one of the 7.7mms replaced with a 12.7mm MG\nKi-43-Ic: most numerous Ki-43-I sub-variant. Same airframe as Ki-43-Ia. Twin 12.7mm machine guns\nKi-43-II: multiple improvements. 1,150HP engine, redesigned canopy, reflector gunsight\nKi-43-IIIa: 1,230 HP engine.\nKi-43-IIIb: Designed by Tachikawa Hikoki KK. 1,250 HP engine. Twin 20mm cannon.\n\n\n\nCombat Service:\nIJA only had 40 aircraft in service when the war with the United States began. However the numbers soon grew, and the Ki-43 fought in every theater where IJA engaged the enemy. In the closing months of the war it was used on kamikaze missions. \n\n\n\n\n  \n

In addition to being the most aesthetically pleasing aircraft to serve with the Japanese air force, and probably all of the Pacific theater, the Ki-46 was also a fast and reliable design loved by her crews.\nThe main variants of the Ki-46 were reconnaissance planes, which saw service from the first days of the war almost to the last. There was also a notable interceptor version, the Ki-46-III KAI with a completely redesigned nose and forward-firing twin 20mm cannon, in addition to an obliquely mounted 37mm cannon. Versions without the top cannon were designated Ki-46-IIIb and -IIIc.\n\nKi-46 versions:\nKi-46-I: first production version. 2 x 900 HP engines\nKi-46-II: upgraded 1,050 HP engines.\nKi-46-III: 1,500 HP engines.

It had an inline engine, long nose and high aspect ratio wings. When Allied airmen first encountered this aircraft they assumed it was either a license built Messerschmitt Bf-109, or some Italian aircraft. The Italian connection was eventually responsible for Ki-61s allied code name, Tony.\nThe Ki-61 actually did have strong links to the German aircraft industry, as it was designed for the license-built Daimler-Benz DB-601Aa engine  a version of the DB-601A with increased low altitude performance requested by the Japanese. The Japanese designers who worked on the Ki-61 were all students of the famous Richard Vogt, the chief designer of Blohm und Voss. The Ki-61 was designed with maneuverability and strength in mind, and included strong armor protection and powerful armament from the start, unlike most other Japanese aircraft that started out vulnerable and weak. It proved to be a great aircraft overall, something of a mix between the Bf-109E7 and the A6M Zero, slightly better than each of them. \nKi-61s were accepted for service in late 1942. Initial operations showed that while the Ki-61 was superb in the air it was hard to maintain in crude frontline conditions, so a simplified version designated Ki-61-I KAIc was produced. Ki-61s saw extensive service in New Guinea and the Philippines, as well as defense of the home islands. Until the arrival of Iwo Jima based P-51s the Ki-61 remained on par with all Allied aircraft it encountered. One can only dream of the performance it could have achieved with a better engine like the DB-605AM.\nAltogether almost 3,100 Ki-61s were produced during the war.\n\nAdvantages:\nGood performance compared to early to mid-war aircraft. Strong armament\n\nDisadvantage:\nOutclassed by late war Allied fighters.\n\n

The engine was supposed to be used on future new aircraft that would gradually freeze out the Macchi MC.200. Saetta aircraft were adopted in Italy from 1939. \n\nTo cut down the time and the cost of development and serial production, it was decided to develop the aircraft for the DB-601A (RA 1000 RC41-1) engine but base construction on the Macchi MC.200 airframe with an asymmetric wing. Alfa Romeo was responsible for serial production of the water-cooled DB-601A engine, rated at 1,175 HP: its Italian version was called the RA 1000 RC41-1. The development of the plane itself was carried out by Macchi.\nThe prototype was called the MC.202  Folgore (Lightning) and left assembly shops at the beginning of August 1940. The new aircraft inherited the wing, tail unit and landing gear parts from its predecessor - the Macchi MC.200. The plane was of all-metal construction and had a new type of fuselage with enclosed cockpit, the middle part of the canopy section opening out to the right. The new plane used secret riveting and the assembly of all parts and surfaces was of very high quality. The first aircraft were armed with two 12.7 mm Breda SAFAT machine-guns. In the same month of 1940, the plane successfully passed full flight trials and was recommended for serial production. \n\nSerial production of MC.202 aircraft was carried out by the firms producing MC.200 fighters. It was planned to produce 15 industrial series of the MC.202 aircraft. In the course of serial production, the aircraft went through slight modification and improvement. About 1,200 MC.202 aircraft of all modifications were produced.\n\nThe MC.202 were used on the Western front in Libya and Sicily, and on the Eastern front on the river Don, Voroshilovograd and Stalingrad.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nMC.202 - Serial aircraft of the first series. Armament: two 12.7 mm Breda SAFAT machine-guns.\nMC.202AS - Serial aircraft adjusted for exploitation in the tropics.\nMC.202 - Serial aircraft of the late series. Armament: two 12.7 mm Breda SAFAT machine-guns and two 7.7mm Breda SAFAT machine-guns. Improved pilot protection.\nMC.202CB - Bomber-fighter. Armament: two 12.7 mm Breda SAFAT machine-guns and two 7.7mm Breda SAFAT machine-guns; bombs of different weight totaling no more than 320 kg.\n\nAdvantages: Good flight characteristics. High maneuverability. Strong armament (on later series). Good field of vision from the cockpit. Simple controls.\n\nDisadvantages: Insufficient armament on the aircraft of the first series.\n
Me-163B-1a        \n    Me-163 B-1a  Komet, 1944.\n\nType: Rocket Interceptor\n\nWeight:\nTake-off: 4,110 kg\n\nLength: 5.80 m\nWingspan: 9.30 m\nWing Area: 18.75 m\n\nEngine: 1 x HWK 509A-2\nThrust: 1,700 kg\u0441\n\nTop Speed:\nSea Level: 825 km/h\n1,000 m: 955 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 12,000 m\nRange: 200\n\nArmament: \n2 x 30-mm MK 108 cannons\n\nIn the late 1930s a group of the German Glider Research Institute (DFS) designers lead by Alexander Lippisch created the DFS-194 rocket plane powered by a RI-203 rocket engine. This was the first time Lippisch, who was one of the top designers of tailless aircraft, fully used his radical new ideas. DFS-194s success opened the door for the RLM order to create a rocket interceptor which would later be designated Me-163.\nAs the engine for the Me-163 took longer to create than the airframe, first test flights were of the unpowered prototype in glider mode. By the summer of 1941 four Me-163As finally received their engines, and full scale testing began. During one of the test flights a top speed of 998 km/h (618 mph) was achieved; beyond that speed the plane would become uncontrollable and enter a shallow dive. \nRemarkably, the Me-163A was never intended for front-line service; it was a test bed/training version. A different variant, Me-163B, was intended for combat and the two variants differed considerably. In essence the project team was working on two different planes at the same time.\nThe test program was understandably plagued with a multitude of problems. The team was breaking new ground in virtually every aspect of the project  engine, fuel, controls of a tailless design, jettisonable undercarriage, etc. Nothing came easy. Flight tests continued for almost three more years, and the first serial Me-163B-1a was deemed combat-worthy in May of 1944.\nUnfortunately the Komets combat record is not nearly as remarkable as its list of innovations. Various sources claim anywhere from 9 to 16 total planes shot down during its combat service  the lowest such record for any serial front-line fighter, especially considering 14 combat losses both in the air and on the ground. The plane was difficult to maintain and dangerous to fly. Additional 17 Me-163s were lost from May 1944 to May 1945 in various accidents. The highest dangers stemmed from the highly combustible and highly unstable fuels; one pilot is said to have literally melted in the cockpit from the fumes. \nDespite all of the disadvantages, the Me-163 is the only rocket fighter in history to have seen combat. Altogether 364 Komets of various modifications were produced.\n\nMain Variants:\nMe-163A-0  ten prototype aircraft\nMe-163Ba-1  40 serial aircraft equipped with 20mm MG-151 cannons\nMe-163B-a  production variant\nMe-163S  two-seater trainer; three examples built\nMe-163C  longer fuselage, pressurized cockpit with bubble canopy. Three prototypes built. \nMe-163D  even larger fuselage than 163C to accommodate for retractable undercarriage, as opposed to the jettisonable dolly/retractable skid on the 163A/B. Later evolved into Me-263/Ju-248. \nKi.200/J8M1  Japanese version. Japan licensed the Me-163 in 1944, but a large part of the blueprints never made it across. The Japanese had to design some components themselves; they were able to build a prototype which flew on June 7th 1945 and crashed on its first flight. \n\nAdvantages:\nUnmatched climb rate and top speed\nPowerful armament\n\nDisadvantages:\nExtremely high maintenance\nShort range and low fuel capacity (about six minutes of powered flight)\nComplicated aiming due to difference between own and target speeds\nComplicated take-off and landing\n\n\n
Me-210Ca-1        \n    Me-210Ca-1, 1943 model\n\nType: Heavy fighter and fast bomber\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 5,400 kg\n    Take-off: 8,200 kg\n\nLength: 12.13 m\nWingspan: 16.34 m\nWing area: 36.2 sq m\n\nEngine: 2x Daimler-Benz DB 605B\nPower: 1,475 HP\n\nTop speed: \n    Sea level: 479 km/h\n    At 6,500 m : 578 km/h\nClimb to 6,000 m: 11min 30 sec \nService ceiling: 10,500 m\nRange: 1,730km with 2,400 liters of fuel\n\nArmament:\n    2x 20 mm (MG-151/20) fixed forward-firing cannons\n    2x 7.92 mm (MG-17) fixed forward-firing machine guns\n    2x 13 mm (MG-131) rearward-firing machine guns in remotely controlled power-operated FDL 131 barbettes on the sides of the fuselage\n    Disposable armament: up to 1,000kg bombs in different variants (1x 1,000kg, 1x 500kg + 4x 70 or 50kg, 4 x 250kg)\n\nIn 1942, the Royal Hungarian Air Force (RHAF) wanted to change most of its 2-engine types of aircraft. The German Me-210A was selected for that purpose.\n\nThe Me 210C was a German export version manufactured in Hungary by the Danube Aircraft Factory under license from Messerschmitt (BFW). Under the terms of the special German-Hungarian Mutual Armament Program for license production, 2/3 of planes manufactured in Hungary would be sent to the Luftwaffe and 1/3 would be used by the RHAF. The Me 210C was almost equal to the Me 210A, but powered by two DB 605B engines of 1,475HP, the engines which were to be used on the Me 410 later. Under the same agreement, the Hungarians would produce the Me-410 from 1944 on.\nThe first Hungarian-built Me-210Ca-1s were sent to the Luftwaffe in April 1943. The first Hungarian units received their aircraft in early 1944. \nThe Hungarians liked their Me-210Ca-1s very much, compared to the German pilots negative experience with the early Me 210As with the short tail. RHAF pilots found the Me-210Ca-1 to be highly maneuverable for a two-engine aircraft type, with excellent performance. \n\nIn the RHAF, this aircraft was used against the Americans as a heavy fighter in April 1944 and as a night fighter in summer 1944. The main role of this type was the fast bomber service in 1944/45 against Soviet ground troops.\n\nA total of 267 Me-210Ca-1s were built. Hungarian production finally ended in March of 1944, and the Danube Aircraft Factory switched over to the manufacture of the Bf -109G-14 and G-10. \nA total of 108 Me-210Ca-1s had been sent to the Luftwaffe under the terms of the German-Hungarian Mutual Armament Program.\n\nMain modifications (besides the normal fast bomber):\n\nMe-210Ca-1 (Z 0+03) heavy fighter variant against American bombers: plus one 40mm Bofors cannon and 6 missiles (it had very strong firepower, but the American fighter escort of bombers was generally too strong to use this successfully).\nMe-210Ca-1 (Z 0+05) night fighter variant with Hungarian 'Turul' radar: just one prototype was made.\nMe-210Ca-1/E (Z 0+08) short-range reconnaissance variant: just one prototype was made with a glassed observer cabin in place of the bomb store, only this variant had a 3-man crew (all the others had just 2 men).\nMe 210 Da-0 long-range reconnaissance variant (6 planes: Z 0+06 - Z 0+11) with RB 20/30 and RB 50/30 cameras, without the front MG 17 machine guns.  \n\nAdvantages: \nFast bomber with great firepower and maneuverability.\n\nDisadvantage:\nWeak flying skills with one engine.\n\n\n

This cannon had an ammo load of a total of 44 rounds, 4 of which were already fitted in the lock. The Bofors was aimed to cross the Revis gunsight at 1,200m. It was fed by the rear gunner, from 4 clip rounds. 4 round clips were stored in the radio-gunners compartment. The 7.92mm (MG-17) fixed forward-firing machine guns were removed. Additionally, the aircraft carried three 150mm rocket-launching tubes under each wing. \nIt was decided to modify about 30-40 aircraft to this configuration , but only 4 or probably 5 were actually finished and delivered to the RHAF.\n\nAdvantages: \nGreat firepower.\n\nDisadvantages:\nToo heavy for a fighter role. Bad climb rate. Weak flying skills with one engine.\n\n\n
Me-262A-1a        \n    Me-262A-1 Schwalbe \n\nType: Jet Fighter\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 4,092kg\n    Take-off: 6,896kg\n\nLength: 10.61m\n    Wingspan: 12.65m\n    Wing area: 21.70 sq. m.\n\nEngine: 2xJumo 109-004.\nPower: rated at 8,83 kN thrust\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level:  835 km/h;\n    At 6,000m: 872 km/h.\n\nClimb to 6,000m: 6.8 min.\nService ceiling: 11,500m\nRange: 1,050 km.\n\nArmament:\n    4x30 mm (MK 108) cannon;\n\nThe history of this aircrafts development spans a period of about five years. Initially the aircraft was designed in autumn 1938 by Messerschmitt for two fundamentally new turbojet engines created by BMW and Junkers. In March 1940, a full-scale wooden model, corresponding to theoretical development work, was made and the factory began construction of three prototypes. All of the prototypes were assembled in early 1941, but further work was put off because of delays caused by modifications to the turbojet engines. The work on the Me-262 was resumed in early 1942 when Jumo 004A-0 turbojet engines - capable of lifting the aircraft up in the air - were developed. However, this work brought no positive results because of problems related to unstable engine operation. The Me-262 was not equipped with improved jets that could provide sufficient thrust and stable operation until January 1943. Trials were carried out in March-April and their success spurred the launch of serial production. \nFull-scale serial production of the Me-262 began early in 1944.\n\nThe first Me-262 serial modification became the Me-262A-1a Schwalbe (Swallow) aircraft, armed with four 30-mm MK 108 guns and equipped with two Jumo 004 turbojets. The construction of the plane used the usual alloys and was riveted, for the most part. The wing was a single box-shaped unit. The lower wing sheeting consisted of panels fastened with screws. The fuselage had four sections: the front section, made of steel, with gun and armament mounting; the central section, with main and additional fuel tanks; the rear section, with radio equipment and rear fuel tanks; and the tail unit. The construction of the plane was devised in such a way as to reduce production time to a minimum.\n\n Advantages: Excellent performance characteristics. Strong armament. Absolute superiority in speed over all contemporary propeller-driven fighters. Good field of vision from the cockpit. Multifunctional. Ability to outfly any pursuer.\n\nDisadvantages: Problems related to turbojet engine maintenance.\n
Me-262A-2a        \n    Me-262A-2 Sturmvogel (Albatross)\n\nType: Jet Fighter/Bomber\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 4,092kg\n    Take-off: 6,896kg\n\nLength: 10.61m\n    Wingspan: 12.65m\n    Wing area: 21.70 sq. m.\n\nEngine: 2xJumo 109-004.\nPower: rated at 8,83 kN thrust\n\nSpeed:\n    Sea level:  835 km/h.\n    At 6,000m: 872 km/h.\n\nClimb to 6,000m: 6.8 min.\nService ceiling: 11,500m\nRange: 1,050 km.\n\nArmament:\n    2x30 mm (MK 108) cannon.\n    Bombs of different weight, no more than 1,000 kg total bomb load.\n\nThe serial Me-262 served as the basis for the creation of a large number of modifications including: missile-armed interceptors (Me262A-1b); reconnaissance aircraft (Me262A-5a); two-seater training aircraft (Me262B-1a); two-seater nocturnal interceptors (Me262B-1a/V1); and bombers with external racks for bombs up to 1,000 kg (Me262A-2 Albatross). \n\n1,435 Me262 aircraft of all modifications were created.\n\nThe Me-262 was the only aircraft that could change the course of the war to German advantage. The plane could take part in combat and made the Allies break off - albeit for a short while - their strategic bombings.\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, the Me-262s were produced in Czechoslovakia from German blueprints till the 50s.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent performance characteristics. Strong armament. Absolute superiority in speed over all contemporary propeller-driven fighters. Good field of vision from the cockpit. Multifunctional. Ability to outfly any pursuer.\n\nDisadvantages: Problems related to turbojet engine maintenance.\n
Me-262HG-II       \n    Me-262HG-II, 1941\n\nType: Jet Fighter\n\nWeight:\n Empty: 4,092 kg\n Take-off: 6,896 kg\n\nLength: 10.61m\nWingspan: 12.65m\nWing area: 21.70 sq m\n\nEngine: 2 x Jumo 004B\nPower: 2 x 900 kg/s\n\nSpeed:\n    At 6,000m: M 0.96\n\nService ceiling: 11,500 m\nRange: 1,050 km\n\nArmament:\n 4 x 30mm MK 108 cannon\n\nThroughout the Me-262 program, the Messerschmitt design bureau had higher aspirations for the series than just the initial production versions. The team continued to work on improving the airframe, and making it faster. The line of higher-speed variants was designated Me-262HG, for Hochgeschwindigkeit - high speed. \n\nThe HG-I prototype, which took several test flights in 1944, was not a radical departure from the Me-262A, and simply exhibited overall cleaner lines. The HG-II was much more different from the production Me-262s, and in addition to the drag-reducing lowered canopy it had swept wings and a V-tail assembly. The HG-III was another departure from the HG-I: it kept the traditional tail unit, but had 45-degree swept wings (as opposed to 35-degrees on the HG-II), and also had a redesigned engine assembly, with the engine nacelles moved inward to the wing root.\n\nNone of the HG designs entered production.\n\nMain Variants:\nMe-262HG-I - lowered cockpit; other drag-reducing changes. One prototype built.\nMe-262HG-II  35-degree swept wing; V-tail. Drawing board only.\nMe-262HG-III  45-degree swept wing; conventional tail; redesigned engine mount. Drawing board only.\n\nAdvantages:\nCapable of sub-sonic speeds\nPowerful armament\n\nDisadvantages:\nLow maneuverability\nUnreliable engines\n\n\n\n
Me-321            \n    Me-321  Giant, 1941 model\n\nType: Glider Transport \n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 12,200 kg.\n    Max. take-off: 39,500 kg.\n\nLength: 28.5 m.\nWingspan: 55.0 m\nWing area: 300.0 sq. m.\n\nMax. tow speed:\n    Behind Troikaschlepp: 215 km/h.\n    Behind He-111Z: 225 km/h.\nGliding speed: 140 km/h\n\nService ceiling: 4,500 m.\nRange: 400 km.\n\nArmament:\n    4x7.92 mm (MG 15).\n\nThe huge Messerschmitt Me-321 Gigant transport glider was initially developed for transporting guns and paratroops when the invasion of Great Britain was being prepared and later when priorities changed to preparing an attack on the Soviet Union.\n\nThe order to develop a super-heavy transport glider was given to the Junkers and Messerschmitt design offices. Glider designs were ready in November 1940.  In the course of competitive selection, the Messerschmitt aircraft was found to be more successful and it was decided to put these planes into serial production under the ME.263 designation (later on Me.321). In February 1941, the first prototype of the gigantic Messerschmitt glider left the assembly shops and performed successfully in flight trials.\n\nThe aircraft was a construction welded from steel pipes with a fabric skinning on top of a wooden framework. The cargo section had the following dimensions: length - 11 m; width - 3.15 m; height - 3.3m. The gliders carrying capacity was a maximum of 20 tons or 200 fully equipped soldiers. The cargo section could be accessed from the front part of the fuselage through two two-way doors.  The cockpit was situated in the upper part of the fuselage. The gliders crew consisted of 6 men - 2 pilots, a radio operator, a load specialist and 2 gunners. The gliders armament consisted of four 7.92mm MG 15 machine-guns, two of which were placed in mountings on the upper part of the front hatch folds, the other two being installed in side windows in the rear of the fuselage.\n\nInitially a Troikaschlepp tow was used to lift the glider up in the air. It consisted of three Bf-110C planes and from 1942 the tow was replaced by a super-powered Heinkel He-111Z aircraft. To make glider take-off easier, up to 4 RATO (Rocket-Assisted Take-Off) devices were used. They were placed under the glider wing, had 750kg of thrust and worked for 30 seconds. For quick braking when landing, a parachute of 20m diameter placed in the tail section of the fuselage was used.\n\nDeveloped initially for landing and transport operations in the Mediterranean theatre of military operations, the Me-321 aircraft was used for the most part on the Eastern front. Me-321 gliders were distributed throughout the Crimea, Dnepropetrovsk, Kherson, Riga, Estonia, Orsha, etc. They were used for supplying the Kuban and Stalingrad forces and took part in the landing on the Moondzun Islands.\n\n200 Me-321 Gigant gliders were produced.\n\nAdvantages: A unique transport glider of its kind. Large carrying capacity. Simple construction.\n\nDisadvantages: Difficult to tow. Heavy flight control.\n
Me-323            \n    Me-323  Giant, 1942 model\n\nType: Transport \n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 29,060 kg.\n    Max. take-off: 45,000 kg.\n\nLength: 28.5 m.\nWingspan: 55.0 m.\nWing area: 300.0 sq. m.\n\nEngine: 6xGnome Rhone GR 14N 48.\nPower: 1,140 HP\n\nSpeed (at full load):\n    Sea level:  235 km/h.\n    At 3,000 m: 195 km/h.\n\nRange: 1,000 km\n\nArmament:\n    2x20 mm (MG 151/20).\n    5x13 mm (MG 131).\n\nThe disadvantages related to the complicated towing system for the Me-321 glider spurred the idea of creating an Me-321 with engine or engines that could support the glider after take-off on the tow or, if possible, assure independent take-off of the glider at full load.\n\nThe possibility of mounting a combination of four or six aviation engines on the plane was considered. A French Gnome Rhone GR 14N 48 engine produced under German orders was chosen. The engine was rated at 1,140 HP at ground level, and 1,035 HP at 4,800 m.\n\nIn autumn 1941, Messerschmitt was entrusted with the design task of equipping two Me-321 gliders with 4 and 6 Gnome Rhone GR 14N 48 engines respectively. As early as spring 1942, prototypes marked Me-323-V1 and Me-323-V2 went through flight trials.\n\nThe Me-323-V1 (later known as the Me-323C) was equipped with 4 engines and still needed a tow for take-off at full load. The inconveniences caused by the complex towing system led to the project being abandoned in favor of the Me-323-V2 (later known as Me-323D) which was equipped with 6 engines and able to take off independently at full load.\n\nMesserschmitt started serial production of the Me-323 in the summer of 1942. The serial Me-323 differed slightly from the basic Me-321 glider. On the whole, the same glider construction was preserved. The aircraft received a new gear consisting of 10 small wheels. The number of illuminators (windows) was reduced. Two flight engineers, responsible for monitoring engine operation, were added to the crew. The aircraft armament consisted of two 20mm MG 151/20 cannons and five 13mm MG 131 machine-guns. The aircraft could carry 120 fully-equipped soldiers or 60 wounded together with attending doctors.\n\nIn the course of serial production of the Me-323, a great deal of Giant modifications were made to provide more powerful armament and engines. 198 Me-323 aircraft of different modifications were produced by the middle of April 1944.\n\nThe Me-323 aircraft were used in the Crimea, Riga, Kirovograd, Sebastopol, Stalingrad, Hungary, Romania, Poland and the Mediterranean theatre, to supply the African force in Tunisia. \n\nAdvantages: A unique transport plane of its kind. Large carrying capacity. Simple construction.\n\nDisadvantages: Low speed. Heavy flight control.\n

It was a result of the French Air Ministrys requirement for a monoplane fighter in 1934. The Morane was first known as the MS.405 and it flew for the first time in the MS.405.01 prototype form in August 1935, powered with one Hispano-Suiza 12Ygrs Vee piston engine. The 20mm Hispano Suiza HS 9 cannon was installed between the engine blocks, shooting through the propeller hub. Some planes had a third 7.5mm machine gun installed instead of the cannon. The Finns found the cannon very unreliable. It often jammed after shooting the first few rounds. The Soviet planes were usually equipped with pilot armor, so the remaining light MGs were practically useless. In some cases, therefore, the cannon was replaced by the 12.7mm Berezina UBS machine gun, which proved to be a good solution.\n\nFrance donated 50 M.S.406s to Finland during the Winter War but only 30 were sent and assembled by French mechanics at AB Aerotransport's facilities in Malm\u00F6, Sweden. The aircraft arrived in Finland between Feb 4th and 29th 1940. After the Winter War and until the fall of 1942, Finland bought 47 more MS.406s and 10 MS.410s from Germany. \n\nNumber built: 1,077 \n\nFAF numbers:\nMS-301...330, MS-601...605, MS-608...611, MS-613, MS-619...620, MS-622...623, MS-625...657 (77 planes)\n\nAdvantages: Good handling. Good turning ability. Reasonably good armament. \n\nDisadvantages: Slightly unstable in aiming. Insufficient performance. Difficult maintenance.\n\n\n

MS-Morko          \n    M\u00F6rk\u00F6 Morane, 1944\n\nType: Fighter\n\nWeight:\n    Empty: 2,210kg\n    Take-off: 2,787kg (typical)\n\nLength: 8.38 m \nWingspan: 10.62 m\nWing area: 17.2 sq. m\n\nEngine: Klimov M-105P \nPower:1,100 HP\n\nTop speed:\n    Sea level:  435 km/h\n    At 4,000m: 525 km/h\nTurn time at 1,000m :  ~17 sec \nClimb to 3,000 m: 5 min 30 sec\nClimb to 5,000 m: 8 min \nService ceiling: ~9,000 m\nRange: 810 km (typical)\n\nArmament:\n    2 x 7.5mm MGs  (4 x 7.5mm MGs  for MS.410)\n    1 x 20 mm MG151/20 cannon shooting through the propeller hub\n\nThe M\u00F6rk\u00F6 (meaning "spook") Morane was a conversion on existing MS.406 aircraft that were in use by the Finnish Air Force. The Germans had captured quantities of the Klimov M-105P engine which were a derivative of the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-series. It offered a greater output of 1,100HP and, with the VIsh-61P propellers, could fulfill its promise. A German 20mm MG151/20 was installed between the cylinder banks, a Bf109G oil cooler was adopted and an aerodynamic cowling was introduced. The first prototype was flown on Feb 4th 1943. \n\nAll FAF Moranes were converted to M\u00F6rk\u00F6 standard by the end of 1945 but only 3 planes were finished before the end of the Continuation War in September 1944. All these aircraft retained their original 2 x 7.5mm (MS.406) or 4 x 7.5mm (MS.410) guns in the wings, but a shortage of the MG151/20 cannon necessitated the use of the 1 x 12.7mm Berezina UBS gun in some planes.\n\nNumber converted: 41\n\nAdvantages: Good handling. Good turning ability. Reasonably good armament. New engine increased battle abilities in speed and climb rates. \n\nDisadvantages: Slightly unstable in aiming. Still insufficient performance. Difficult maintenance.\n\n\n
N1K1-J            \n    Kawanishi N1K1-J Shiden\n\nType: \n\nWeight:\nEmpty: 2,897 kg (6,387 lbs)\nMaximum: 4,321 kg (9,526 lbs)\n\nLength: 8.9 m (29 ft)\nWingspan: 12 m (39 ft 4 in)\nWing area: 23.5 sq m (252 sq ft)\n\nEngine: 1 x NK9H Homare 21\nPower: \t1,990 HP (take-off)\n\t\t1,825 HP (at 1,700 m  5,576 ft)\nTop speed: 584 km/h (363 mph)\n\nService Ceiling: 12,500 m (41,010 ft)\nRange: 2,545 km (1,581 miles)\n\nArmament:\n2 x Type 97 7.7mm machine guns\n4 x Type 99 Model 2 20mm cannon\n(N1K1-J)\n\n4 x Type 99 Model 2 20mm cannon\n(N1K1-Ja)\n\nThe N1K1-J was a land-based version of Kawanishis successful N1K1 floatplane. In addition to replacing the floats with retractable landing gear, and installing a new 2,000 HP engine the changes were not significant. The Shiden was also equipped with an automatic flap system. The first prototype flew in late December of 1942.\nAfter taking care of multiple issues with the engine and undercarriage, a prototype was sent to the Navy for evaluation. It exhibited great flying qualities and maneuverability superior to that of the famous A6M Zero. Initially reluctant Navy ordered N1K1-Js into production in late 1943.\nUnfortunately N1K1-Js combat service was plagued with engine and landing gear problems. However in the air the plane performed beautifully, and was more than a match for contemporary US fighters. \nAs N1K1-Js were being produced, Kawanishi began work on the next version which would eliminate the engine and undercarriage troubles of the initial variant. The new version was designated N1K2-J and entered production in June of 1944. Altogether some 1,400 Shidens were produced during the war, and they were widely considered to be some of the best Japanese fighters by Allied airmen.\n\nAdvantages:\nSuperb performance. Strong armament.\n\nDisadvantages: \nUnreliable engine. Teething problems with landing gear.\n\n\n\t\n
N1K2-Ja           \n    N1K2-J, 1944\n\nType: Fighter / Interceptor\n\nAllied Code Name: George II\n\nWeight:\nEmpty: 2,657 kg\nTake-off: 4,000 kg\n\nLength: 9.34 m\nWingspan: 12 m\nWing area: 23.5 sq m\n\nEngine: 1 \u0425 Nakajima NK9H Homare 21\nPower: \n1,990 HP for take-off\n1,825 at 1,750 m\n\nTop speed:\nAt 5,600 m: 593 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 10,760 m\nRange: 2,394 km\n\nArmament:\n4 \u0425 20mm Type 99 Model 2 cannon\n4 \u0425 machine guns (rounds per gun)\nUp to 500 kg of bombs\n\nA further development of the Kyofu seaplane, the Shiden-A, or George II as it was known to the Allies, was the main focus of Japanese aviation industry in the spring of 1944. While the N1K1 was a good fighter, it suffered from several inherent problems, and the radical redesign was to address them all. The legacy of the Kyofu floatplane, the mid-wing, was replaced with a low-wing, the landing gear was shortened, the fuselage redesigned and lengthened, and the taIL-plane redone from scratch. In the end, the N1K2 was virtually a whole new plane, only keeping the wing shape, the Homare 21 engine, and the four 20-mm Type 99 cannons.\n\nThe redesign was also a drastic improvement in terms of manufacturing techniques. The number of required parts was cut from 66,000 for the N1K1 to only 43,000 to N1K2. The Shiden Kai could be built cheaper and faster.\n\nThe reduction in weight and all other improvements combined to make the N1K2 quite possibly the best Japanese fighter of the war. In capable hands, it was more than a match for the F6F Hellcat and the P-51 Mustang.\n\nDue to constant B-29 raids and other difficulties late in the war, only 400-some Shiden Kais were produced.\n\nAdvantages:\nGood forward visibility\nPowerful armament\nExcellent low- and medium-altitude performance\n\nDisadvantages:\nHigh wing loading\nInferior high-altitude performance\nPoor rate of climb\n\n\n
Ta-152H-1         \n    Ta-152 H-1 1944.\n\nType: High Altitude Interceptor\n\nWeight:\nTake-off: 4,754 kg\nMaximum: 5,220 kg\n\nLength: 10.80 m\nWingspan: 14.44 m\nWing Area: 23.5 sq.m\n\nEngine: 1 x Jumo-213\u0415-1\nPower:\nTake-off: 2,050 HP\nIndicated: 1,870 HP \nAt Altitude 3,250 m\n\nTop Speed:\nSea Level: 562 km/h\nAt 9,000 m: 752 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 14,800 m\nRange: 1,200 \u043Am\n\nArmament: \n2 x 20-mm MG-151/20 cannon\n1 x 30-mm MK 108 cannon\n\nIn late 1940 the Focke Wulf Company began work on an improved version of the FW-190 which could reach higher altitudes than the FW-190A1.  Initially the new plane was supposed to use the BMW-801 engine; later Jumo-213A and DB-603 engines were also used. Altogether 15 FW-190s were used to test various components. \nAfter the FW-190V13 prototype was tested the design team decided to use the DB-603 instead of the BMW-801. V13 was thus modified and became a prototype for FW-190C, which never entered large-scale production. As for the Jumo-213A prototypes, theyve become the famous Dora, the long-nosed FW-190D.\nFurther development continued, and FW-190D evolved into the FW-190Ra-2 and FW-190Ra-3 prototypes. The latter had an increased wingspan, which made it better suited for high altitude flight. Both prototypes had the Jumo-213E engine with two-stage three-speed supercharger. Other new features included pressurized cockpits and hydraulic gear and flap control (FW-190D used electric power). Also the tail and fuselage were enlarged, and cockpit moved back. These and other modifications became the basis for the new plane designated Ta-152.\nSerial production variant Ta-162H-1 received a new wing with 14.44 m wingspan, which was designed for the Ta-153. Most of the produced aircraft were of the Ta-152H-1/R11 variant. Altogether about 150 Ta-152s were built. The work on the fighter took too long, and not a single squadron could be fully equipped with the Ta-152s before the end of the war. Many of the planes that did see front line service were used for tasks other than that for which the Ta-152 was designed, for example low-altitude escort of Me-262s landing and taking off.\n\nMain Variants:\nTa-152C DB-603L engine. Three prototypes built\nTa-152E  photo reconnaissance based on the Ta-152C\nTa-152H-0 Jumo-213EB engine. Twenty built.\nTa-152H-1  main variant with the Jumo-213E engine\n\nAdvantages: \nExcellent speed for a piston engine fighter.\nGood climb rate\nPowerful armament\n\nDisadvantages:\nAs the plane was designed for high altitude combat, its low altitude performance was less that stellar.\n\n\n
Ta-183            \n    Ta-183, 1941\n\nType: Jet Fighter\n\nWeight:\n Empty: 2,980 kg\n Take-off: 5,100 kg\n \nLength: 9.2 m\nWingspan: 10.0 m\nWing area: 22.5 sq m\n\nEngine: 1 x Heinkel HeS 011\nPower: 1,300 kg/s\n\nTop speed: \nAt 7,000 m: 955 km/h\n\nService Ceiling: 14,400 m\nRange: 1,740 km\n\nArmament:\n 4 x 30mm MK 108 cannon (forward-firing)\n Up to 500 kg of bombs\n\nThe Ta-183 was the granddaddy of them all. Whether by weight of experience or by sheer stroke of genius, this design paved the way for countless others that followed. Some merely copied it, but most reached the same conclusions after years of painful trial and error. One way or another, short fuselage with a bubble canopy, engine mount, air intakes, thin swept wings, and the T-tail of most post-war jet fighters used the same configuration as this German prototype that never even took to the air. \n\nThe Ta-183s development began as early as 1942, but progress was slow at first, with nothing but a few sets of blueprints and wooden mock-ups built during the next two years. Finally, by February of 1945, the design competition held by RLM picked the by-now mature project over all others, including the Messerschmitt P.1101, and designated the project Ta-183. 16 prototypes were to be built by May of 1945, but the development was cut short by British troops that captured the production line in April. \n\nContrary to popular myth, the Soviet I-310 prototype (which would later become the famous MiG-15), was not directly based on the Ta-183. The I-310 was created based on the experience gained from the I-300 prototype (later known as MiG-9), which in turn was a radical departure from a failed I-260 prototype, which was similar in appearance to the Me-262 and proved to the Soviet designers that the twin under-wing engine mounts were a dead end. In the end, after two costly projects that spanned over two years of development, by 1947 the MiG design bureau ended up reaching the same conclusions that Hans Multhopp at Focke-Wulf discovered almost five years prior.\n\nMain Variants:\nDesign II  - The variant chosen by RLM for development. Wings swept at 40 degrees; T-tail atop the fuselage; 4 x MK 108 cannon.\nDesign III  a later prototype; 35-degree wing sweep; cockpit moved farther back; more conventional tail; 2 x MK 108 cannon.\n\nAdvantages:\nHigh speed\nEase of production\n\nDisadvantages:\nLow-speed control problems due to wing configuration\n\n

Several Japanese trading companies ordered 20 DC-3s and received them in 1939. They served with the Japanese air force until the end of the war.\nIn 1938 Mitsui and Company Ltd also acquired a manufacturing license from Douglas and began producing their own variants under the designation of Douglas L2D. Unbeknownst to Douglas, Mitsui had been working under the direction of the Japanese Navy all along, and the L2Ds were intended for Navy use.\nThe first main production version, L2D1, was basically an unmodified DC-3. The second version, L2D2, had been modified to use Japanese engines.  The next modification, L2D3, received more powerful 1,300 HP engines. Finally, L2D4 had been fitted with a dorsal turret and 2 more machine guns in fuselage hatches. Altogether 416 L2Ds of all variants have been produced in Japan. \n\n\n
