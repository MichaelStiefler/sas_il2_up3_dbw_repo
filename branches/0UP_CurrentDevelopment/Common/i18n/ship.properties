g5_NAME                    Torpedo boat G-5
g5_INFO                    \n    Torpedo boat G-5\n\nSpeed: 50 knots\nArmament: two torpedoes of 533 mm caliber, two machine-guns, four mines.\nDisplacement: 14.5 tons\nPower of two petrol engines: 1,700 HP\nProduced till 1944 in different modifications.\nTotal number produced: over 200 units.\n\nThe order to design the first speed-boat for river flotillas in the USSR was received in 1920. And, as early as the following summer, the Moscow river saw test trials of the GANT-1 - a planing boat with 1 ton displacement and a 160 HP engine capable of traveling at up to 75 km/h. The first model was followed by new modernized modifications. \n\nOn June 29 1928, it was decided to develop a new and better launch with two domestically-produced engines and two torpedo-tubes marked G-5 (planing boat #5). A year later, on June 13 1929, construction of the GANT-5 prototype started. Completed GANT-5 launches were sent to Sebastopol on February 15 1933 and the trials dragged on into the last days of December. The trials proved the G-5 to be the best adopted torpedo boat, and serial production was launched.\n\nAbout 200 G-5 torpedo boats were produced. \n\n

bbk42_NAME                 BBK-1/rocket turret
bbk42_INFO                 \n    BBK-1 Patrol Boat/Gun Boat with rocket turret M-13-M1\n\nSpeed: 21 knots\nCitadel and crew compartment armor: 5-8 mm.\nArmament: 76 mm gun in the turret of T-28 tank, M-13-M1 mounting for launching 16 missiles of 132 mm caliber, two 12.7 machine-guns. \nDisplacement: 47.3 tons\nPower of two petrol engines: 1,700 HP\n\nThe job of creating armored launches equipped with missile mountings started in January 1942. The Navy command ordered the industry to create launcher mountings from land battle vehicles BM-8 and EM-13. It turned out, however, that the ships needed mountings with a large horizontal turning angle. Land Katushas were pointed in an approximate fashion at the target with a turn of the vehicle, but one could not rely on this method when an armored launch was moving along a narrow waterway. This prompted the development of superstructure mounting M-13-M1, which was intended for launching 16 missiles of 132 mm caliber. Missiles were fired by the commander from the crew compartment and salvo from eight flange beams took 5 to 8 seconds. The M-13-M1 was only installed on large armored launches.\n\n

bbk43_NAME                 BBK-1/T-34-76 turrets
bbk43_INFO                 \n    BBK-1 Patrol Boat/Gun Boat, project series 1124\n\nSpeed: 21 knots.\nCitadel and crew compartment armor: 5-8 mm.\nArmament: two 76 mm guns in the turret of T-34 tank, two 12.7 machine-guns.\nDisplacement: 47.3 tons.\nPower of two petrol engines: 1,700 HP\n\nThe need for launches armed with 76 mm guns and anti-bullet armor became apparent as early as 1929 during an armed conflict on the Chinese-Eastern railway. But the first such design was only commissioned at the end of 1934. The naval forces wanted to have a two-turret artillery launch with anti-bullet armor. It was initially planned to arm armored launches with 45 mm guns in the turrets of T-26 tank. Later on, they were replaced by short-barreled mountain 76 mm guns in the turrets of T-28 and T-35 tanks which were at that time adopted by the Red Army. Such solutions made it possible to provide launches with ammo direct from army warehouses. Tank turrets had a gun elevation angle of a mere 26 degrees, which excluded the possibility of firing at aircraft; machine-guns were mounted for combating enemy aviation. After the successful completion of test trials, the armored launch was put into serial production. In the course of production it went through a number of modifications, the most essential of which was the replacement of turrets from T-28 and T-35 tanks with those from T-34 with 76 mm guns.\n\nBy the beginning of the Second World War, the Soviet Navy had 85 launches of both types and another 68 were under construction. \n\n

type7_NAME                 Destroyer type 7
type7_INFO                 \n    Destroyer type 7, "Razumniy" \n    Type 7 Flotilla Leader\n\nApart from a few Dreadnoughts, the destroyer of the "Razumniy" ("reasonable") type was one of the largest ships in the Soviet Navy at the time of the Second World War. It was armed with four 130  mm B-13 guns, two 12.7 mm Colt machine-guns (later replaced by DShK machine-guns), two 76 mm 34K guns, four 37 mm K-37 machine guns and two 12.7 mm DShK machine-guns (different production series had different machine-gun equipment). The ship was also equipped with torpedo-tubes and devices for dropping anti-submarines bombs. \n\n

transp_NAME                Minesweeper
transp_INFO                \n    Minesweeper\n\nSpeed: 21 knots. \nArmament: 100 mm caliber gun, 45 mm caliber gun, 37 mm caliber gun, 40 mines.\nDisplacement: 450 tons\nDiesel engine power: 3,000 HP\n\nThe first surface ship completely designed and constructed by the Soviet shipbuilding industry was a trawl-class minesweeper which entered service in 1934. This construction and maintenance experience served as a basis for developing more powerful and fully-equipped trawlers which started shipping to the Navy from 1942 on. Trawl-class minesweepers were created "right from the draft", as designers put it - the trials of leading and serial ships brought no unpleasant surprises and revealed no drawbacks or blunders. As a result, construction was quick to get under way in small shipbuilding plants.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the range of this type of ship in battle was significantly extended. Apart from their main task of clearing mines from waterways, Soviet minesweepers were also used to lay mine barriers, conduct anti-submarine operations, escort troops and civilians, land troops in the enemy rear and support them with artillery fire.\n

aurora_NAME                Aurora Cruiser
aurora_INFO                \nLength: 126.7 m.\nBeam: 16.8 m.\nAverage draught: 6.2 m\nDisplacement: 6731 tons\nSpeed: 20 knots\nPower of engines: 11,971 HP\nArmament:  10 x 130 mm, 4 x 76 mm, 3 x 45 mm , 3 torpedo tubes\n\nThe cruiser of the first rank Aurora entered into service on July 29, 1903. On May 14-15, 1905, this ship participated in a battle in the Japanese sea (Tsusima). On November 7, 1917 at 09:45, a signal from the nose gun was given to commence the attack of the Winter Palace. This shot was effectively the signal for the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia. From the autumn of 1918 onwards, the Aurora was kept in conservation in an inner harbor of Kronstadt. At the beginning of the summer of 1923, the Aurora cruiser was again put into service in the Baltic fleet as a training ship.\nDuring the period of the Leningrad blockade from 1941-1944, the Aurora was located in the port of Oranienbaum. The cruiser had received considerable damage from systematic fire and bombardments by German aviation. It took on a considerable amount of water, and in September 27, 1941 sat on the ground. In July 1944, the cruiser had been raised from the ground and was put into repair.\nFrom 1948 to 1956, the Aurora cruiser was used as a training base.\nIn 1956, the Aurora became the branch of a Central Naval museum of Leningrad.\n\n

In September 1938, it was commissioned to the Soviet Fleet. Six "Kirov" type cruisers were built (2 project 26 and 4 project 26bis). The "Kirov" faced war at Riga's harbor. On August 1, the ship was sent to Tallin's base. On August 29, it was moved to the Kronstadt base. Up until September 21, the Kirov was involved in anti-aircraft defense of  Kronshtadt, was damaged and relocated to Leningrad, on the Neva river. In the spring of 1942, the Axis tried once more to destroy it by combined artillery and aircraft attacks. The ship again suffered a small amount of damage, and was subsequently relocated and better camouflaged. An old training ship was positioned in its old place (and was immediately sunk by the Axis, who were sure they had sunk the "Kirov", whereupon attacks subsequently ceased). The Cruiser was repaired, upgraded and put into action in June 1944 on the "Mannergeim's line" in the direction of Vyborg. The ship ended its duty in 1974 as a USSR NAVY Cruiser.\n\n

Entered service with the Soviet Navy (VMF USSR) on April 18th, 1939. At the Marti factories in Nikolaev the ship was temporarily armed with three single 130mm B-13 guns. Tashkent received her final armament of six B-13s in June of 1941, just a few days before the German invasion. During the same time the ships 45mm flak cannons were replaced with 37mm machine guns. In August of 1941 the ship also received a turreted twin 76mm AA gun, which was taken off an unfinished destroyer Ognevoy.\nDuring the next year of the war the ship served with the Black Sea Navy. She served as an escort on 17 transport convoys, and was used as a transport herself, transporting 19,300 men and 2,538 tons of cargo during the defense of Sevastopol and Odessa. Tashkents crew claimed 9 enemy planes damaged and 4 destroyed, sunk one torpedo boat, and fired barrages at ground targets on over 100 occasions. \nOn June 26th, 1941 as Tashkent was returning from Odessa with hundreds of refugees on board, she was dive bombed by German aircraft and heavily damaged. On July 2nd, 1942 at around 12 pm she was attacked by around 30 German bombers as she was moored in a Novorossiysk harbor. Tashkent received two direct hits and partially sank in the shallow waters. Out of 344 men on board 76 were killed and 77 wounded. The ship was only raised in 1944 after liberation of Novorossiysk. Investigation showed that the ship was too damaged to be restored, and after the war the Tashkent was salvaged for spare parts. \n\n

In March 1921, it was renamed the "Marat". It was upgraded in 1931. The Marat was involved in the Soviet-Finnish war. At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, it participated in Leningrad's defense, where it took some damage from several ship bomb explosions. It was subsequently sent to Kronstadt for repair. In Kronstadt, the "Marat" was used for anti-aircraft defense against numerous air attacks. After the 13th massive air attack (from some 40 dive-bombers) on the morning of September 23, 1941, it was hit by 500-kg and 1000-kg bombs to the nose at the same time (the strike was by Hans-Ulrich Rudel). The explosions caused a huge detonation of ammo stored in the nose that destroyed the whole nose part of the ship and the nose superstructure. The ship took on around 1000 tons of water and touched the ground. 326 people died. The AAA guns at the stern continued anti-aircraft defense. That day, the ship fired 1,002 76.2-mm cannon rounds, 528 37-mm rounds and 6,584 12.7-mm rounds. In late October 1941, 2 stern turrets was repaired and the ship was used as a floating artillery battery up until January 1944. The 120-mm cannons were removed and sent to frontlines for ground battles.\n\n

It was named after the events of April 19, 1775, when the Minutemen fighting British troops at Lexington, MA, opening the Revolutionary War. Three previous US warships also had this name.\n\nHowever in February of 1922 construction was suspended, and it was decided to convert the CC-1 to an aircraft carrier, which was redesignated CV-2. Another of the Lexington-class Battle Cruisers, CC-3 Saratoga, was also converted to an aircraft carrier in the same order, redesignated CV-3. For almost the next 20 years CV-2 and CV-3 were the main carriers of the US carrier force, the other two operational carriers being much smaller and slower.\n\nCV-2 was fatally damaged by Japanese aircraft in the Battle of the Coral Sea on May 8th, 1942. She was scuttled by USS Phelps the same day and sank.\n\nCV-3 survived many close calls during the war only to be used as a stationary target in 1946 atomic bomb tests at Bikini atoll.\n\n\n

Same act authorized what was later to become the Lexington class aircraft carriers.\nHowever as most of the Wickes class DDs were commissioned right around the end of WWI, they were mostly decommissioned in the 1920s. However in early 1940s as it became increasingly clear that the US would be involved in a war sooner or later, most were recommissioned either for US service or sent to Great Britain under the lend-lease act.\nIt was a Wickes class destroyer, USS Ward (DD-139) that fired the first shot of the war between Japan and United States. During an early morning patrol of Hawaiian waters on the fateful Sunday, December 7th, 1941, it noticed a Japanese midget submarine and quickly sank it. Unfortunately Wards reports were ignored, and the rest of the Japanese air raid on Pearl Harbor proceeded without a hitch.\nWickes destroyers continued to serve with the US Navy throughout the war. Even though they were basically obsolete by 1930s, they were converted into APDs (fast transport) and proved invaluable during the island hopping campaign in the Pacific\n\n\n

They were so uncommonly large for a destroyer that Allied crews often identified them as cruisers. They began with a 1936 Imperial Japanese Navy plan for special air defense destroyers, which were to be used in all carrier groups.\nThrough trial and error the Akizuki class destroyers continued to be modified throughout the war, receiving increasingly heavy armament. They participated in virtually every naval battle in the Pacific, and majority were sunk by the time hostilities ended.\n\n\n

mas501_INFO                \nSpeed: 42 knots\nArmament: 2 x 450mm torpedo tubes and 2 x 13.2mm machineguns \nDisplacement: 24 tons\nLength: 17m\nBeam: 4.4m\nDraft: 1.25m\nEngines: 2 gasoline engines with a total of 2,000HP plus 2 auxiliary engines giving 80HP, driving 2 shafts\nCrew: 11 men\n\nThe MAS 501 was the first in a progressively improved series of successful Italian fast attack crafts built between 1936 and 1941. In total, 76 vessels were built. With slight variations in AA armament, but keeping the 2x 450mm torpedoes, the later boats were given stronger engines and a slightly larger hull. From MAS 556, the boats had steel hulls as opposed to wooden hulls earlier.\n\nAn MAS flotilla operated in the Black Sea from May 1942 until May 1943. The Italian crews displayed great \u00E9lan on several occasions and sunk a Soviet submarine, a 5,000-ton steamer and a transport of unknown tonnage, and crippled a 10,000-ton transport (later sunk by a German Junker 87). An MAS 573 and 568 attacked and damaged the destroyer Kharkov and crippled the cruiser Molotov (Kirov class) while saving a German convoy.\nThe flotilla endured many Soviet air attacks both in port and at sea. One such raid sank 2 and seriously damaged 3 other MAS in port. The losses were replaced with new boats from Italy.\n\nIn summer 1942, two boats were transported by a truck column to Lake Ladoga north of Leningrad. During its short stay on Lake Ladoga, the MAS were used in support of the Siebel f\u00E4hren operating there, engaging in several clashes with the Soviet Ladoga flotilla. In November, the two MAS were given to Finnish Navy and the crews returned in Italy.\n\n

Built between 1940 and 1945, these boats were modified in the light of operational experience. In particular, the light flak armament was tripled in later boats. Powered by the 20-cylinder Daimler Benz diesel, they were able to record speeds of over 40 knots. \nFrom S100 on, the boats were equipped with an armoured control platform to protect the crew. \n\nMost of the 100 boats built were lost during the war, either through mine hits or during battles and air attacks. The surviving boats were given to various countries after the war. The Soviet Union used several of them until the 1950s.\n\n\n

After Holland's capitulation, this ship was converted to an anti-aircraft cruiser (AA-cruiser) and then renamed the Niobe. The Niobe was typical of the floating AA-batteries of that period.\nThe Niobe sank in Kotka harbor on July 16, 1944 after a successful, but bloody attack of Soviet naval aviation. 4 enemy torpedoes reached their target, but all four torpedo bombers were shot down by the Niobe's artillery.\n\n

In the beginning of the war the coastal defence ships supported the small Finnish force that repulsed the attack on Bengtsk\u00E4r. During this they came under attacked by 18 PE-2s. Two bombs detonated just behind Ilmarinen, causing splinter damage and light personnel losses. \nDuring the diversion manoeuvre for operation Nordwind ( German invasion of the islands in the Riga bay ) Ilmarinen was lost to Soviet mines. \nAfter the loss of Ilmarinen, V\u00E4in\u00E4m\u00F6inen shelled the Hanko area one last time 15.11.1941. These were the last heavy shells fired by Finnish ships, except some practice shots. During the following three years of war, V\u00E4in\u00E4m\u00F6inen stayed mostly in the area west from "Seeigel" and "Nashorn" mine barrages. V\u00E4in\u00E4m\u00F6inen was the center of "Detachment V\u00E4in\u00E4m\u00F6inen", whose tasks were antisubmarine operations in the west and attacks against heavier units. The unit remained mostly out of battles, as heavier enemy units never sailed out from Leningrad. Only light securing forces of "Detachment V\u00E4in\u00E4m\u00F6inen" attacked sometimes Soviet submarines. \nDuring 1942 V\u00E4in\u00E4m\u00F6inen, six VMV patrol boats and six motor mine sweepers, was based on the coast between Helsinki and Kotka. V\u00E4in\u00E4m\u00F6inen remained camouflaged and moved only when it was needed. Even if the Finnish gunboats could not cope with enemy, the Navy command was doubtful to send V\u00E4in\u00E4m\u00F6inen into action. During 1943 the most important task of "Detachment V\u00E4in\u00E4m\u00F6inen" was to lead the submarine hunting operations east from the Porkkala-Naissaari submarine net. This was mostly done by the smaller ships of the detachment.\nDuring the Soviet offencive in summer 1944, V\u00E4in\u00E4m\u00F6inen was kept as a last line of defence, hidden west of Kotka. When the relations to Germany were deteriorating after the cease fire with the Soviets, V\u00E4in\u00E4m\u00F6inen with support ships and the Submarine Flotilla were moved to the Ahvenanmaa - Saaristomeri area. Their task was to guard Ahvenanmaa.\n\nV\u00E4in\u00E4m\u00F6inen was sold to Soviet Union as part of war reparations after the war. She then served more than 10 years under the name Vyborg.\n\n

submar_NAME                Submarine Type IIB
submar_INFO                \n    U-boat, type II B\n\nSeries II submarines had a displacement of only 250 tons and dimensions that justified the "submarines for coastal operation" classification. They were the first submarines launched in the Kriegsmarine.\n\nFrom the very beginning, there was no place for submarines of the II series in Navy commands strategic plans. However, the situation at the onset of war required the quick deployment of small submarines as well. It soon turned out that series II was as good as useless in the struggle for the Atlantic and this was the reason why submarines were used as mine barriers in 1940 and the beginning of 1941. In June 1941 all submarines of series II were called back from the Atlantic and moved to the Baltic sea where they were used for training purposes and sporadically against the Soviet Baltic fleet.\n\nNevertheless, a battle theatre was soon found for series II as well. In the late summer of 1941, six submarines of this type were transported by rail to Konstanza (Romania) to fight against the Soviet fleet on the Black Sea and to effect a blockade of the main naval stronghold - Sebastopol. Six of these submarines were used with relative success till 1944, when they were lost in the major defeat on the Black Sea. Three submarines were sunk on August 20 1944 by aviation of the Black Sea Fleet in Konstanza harbor. On September 9, after Bulgaria dropped out of the war and German submarines lost their last bases on the Black Sea, the three remaining submarines were sunk off the Turkish coast. Due to their training status, other series II submarines survived the war and either surrendered or were sunk in 1945.\n
