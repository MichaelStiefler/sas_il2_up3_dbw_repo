Based on the dual running gear M-1931 (T-3) tank made by American designer W.J. Christie. The tracks could be removed and the tank then moved on supporting road wheels. Changing gear from wheel to track drive took about half an hour; it was possible to change over at any time. This made it possible to reach speeds that were unheard-of for armored vehicles in those times. The BT-7 was designed in conformity with the theory of deep offensive operation for breaking deep into enemy defenses, and for quick offensive operations without infantry support.\n\nAfter 1935 5,556 BT-7 units of all types were produced.\n\nThe main modifications of these are:\nBT-7 - Basic modification. 4,613 units produced. Hull of mainly welded construction, cylindrical turret;\nBT-7A - Artillery tank. 156 units produced. Supplied with T-26-4 turret from T-26 tank. Armament: KT-26 76 mm main gun and 2 DT machine-guns. Weight 13.5 tons;\nBT-7M - Model 1937. 787 units produced. Comes with a B-2 400 HP diesel engine (294.5kW), max speed on track - 62 km/h, 86 km/h on wheels. Weight 14.65 tons. \n\n BT-7 tanks were widely used in battles on all fronts right up to August 1945 when the Japanese Quantun army was crushed.\n

It was developed in 1939 and was intended to replace the T-37A and T-38 tanks. The hull was made of welded or riveted rolled armor plates. Only the hull shape ensured the tank's stability on water; there were no floats. In the bottom part of the real hull there was an opening to fit a four-bladed ships propeller and two rudder surfaces. The turret, in the form of a truncated cone, was placed on a ball bearing and was offset to the left.\n\nFrom October 1940 to 1941, 709 units were produced. By the middle of 1942, almost all these tanks were lost in military operations.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nT-40 - Basic prototype. Displacing welded hull. The turret was in the form of a truncated cone and was offset to the left side, while the engine was offset to the right. Amphibian. \nT-40S - Land version.

The T-60's hull was made of riveted armor plates at first; later, welded armor plates were introduced. Front plates were inclined considerably. A cut turret with a commander's hatch in the roof was offset to the left and a TNSh-20 gun (the tank version of the ShVAK aviation cannon) was placed in it. The gun was effective for firing at light and medium armored vehicles.\n\nT-60s were first used in winter 1941 for the defense of Moscow. Their last large operation was the siege of Leningrad, where the breakthrough came in January 1944.\n\n5,915 units were produced from 15 September 1941 to 1943.\n\nA small number of BM-8-24 rocket launchers were built on the T-60 chassis. Both tanks and rocket launchers were used till the end of the war.\n

The tank hull was made of welded rolled armor plates. The thickness of the T-70 front armor plates could be compared to that of the T-34 medium tank. The welded turret, accommodating a single person, was offset to the left. For better protection, armor plate junctions were covered by armored squares. \n\nMain modifications:\n\nT-70 - Basic tank model.\nT-70 - Commander's tank with 9P wireless station. Armament: 45 mm tank gun, 1938 model and DT machine-gun.\nT-70M - Tank with improved running gear. Production launched in 1942. Armament: 45 mm main gun, 1938 model and DT machine-gun. Equipped with driver's periscope device. Weight: 9.8 tons.\n\nThe T-70 and T-70M were adopted by the so-called mixed brigades and regiments jointly with the T-34. These tanks were also used as command vehicles in divisions, regiments and brigades with SU-76 self-propelled mountings. They took part in military operations until the end of the war. 8,226 units were built from March 1942 until autumn 1943.\n\n

The first vehicles were adopted in May 1940. Serial production of infantry Valentine tanks ended in early 1944. About 8,275 units were produced, 1,420 of which were assembled in Canada. The USSR received 3,782 Valentines of all modifications except Valentine I under the lend-lease program (1,388 of these were made in Canada).\n\nThe Valentine was highly popular with the Soviet tank units and its battle durability was proved directly in military operations. The English tanks first took part in military operations on the Soviet-German front during the battle for Moscow. In 1942-1943, they formed part of the separate tank brigades and battalions, together with domestically produced tanks, the T-70 and T-60 for the most part. When the war entered its final stages, only the Valentine tanks armed with 57 mm guns remained.\n\n

The first T-34 prototype was produced in January 1940. In the course of intensive trials, the tank went through a large number of extensive design revisions. Then serial production began in most Soviet manufacturing plants. It should be noted that each production plant introduced some changes and additions to the tank design in accordance with its technological capacities and tanks produced by different plants could be distinguished from one another by their outward appearance.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nThe Red Army did not differentiate tanks by series, like the T-34A or the T-34B. Instead, the classification of tanks was based on the year of manufacture. This was not a perfect system, since often many modifications were made during the same year. \nT-34, 1940 model - the first serial version. Weight 26.2 tons, L-11 76 mm turret. Two crewmen: driver and gunner, who had to act as driver, spotter, commander, aimer, gunner and loader.\nT-34, 1941 model - modified turret for the F-34 gun, cast gun mount, modified driver hatches and turrets. Weight 26.5 tons. \nT-34, 1942 model - large turret. Modified driver hatch. Increased armor protection of hull and turret. Weight 28.5 tons. \nT-34, 1943 model - increased armor protection of hull and turret. The tanks from this series had simplified hexagonal turrets equipped with a small turret for the tank commander. Weight: 30.9 tons.\nTO-34 - flame-throwing version. Machine-gun replaced by ATO-41/ATO-42 flame-thrower.\n\n35,312 units of all modifications were produced from 1940 to 1944, 1,170 of which were flame-throwing models.\n\nThe T-34 was used as the basis for producing self-propelled artillery mountings, commander's tanks, bridge layers, mine sweeping tanks, flame-throwing tanks, recovery vehicles and other special purpose vehicles.\n

t3485_NAME          T-34-85
t3485_INFO          \n    T-34-85, 1944 model\n\nType: Medium Tank\nCrew: Four \nArmament: 85 mm caliber ZIS-S-53 gun, 2 DT machine-guns of 7.62 caliber. \nAmmo: 60 shells; 1,920 DT rounds.\nArmor: front - 47  mm, sides - 60  mm, rear - 47  mm, roof - 20  mm, bottom - 21  mm, turret - 75 to 90  mm.\nMax Speed: 55 km/h \nRange: 360 km\nEngine: V-2-34, 400 HP (294.5kW), diesel, liquid cooled.\nWeight: 32 tons\n\nBased on the 1942 model T-34. It was equipped with a new cast turret with a more powerful 85 mm main gun. There was a small commander turret on the turret roof and its two-fold lid rotated on a ball bearing. Power plant, transmission and running gear were left practically unchanged. \n\nDue to the addition of a larger gun and a new crew member (an additional gunner in the turret), the tank had a much larger interior space. This made it more vulnerable, especially in the lower turret area.\n\nProduction of the T-34 armed with 85 mm gun started in autumn 1943; the T-34-85 started appearing in Red Army military units from March 1944 and quickly squeezed out earlier T-34 versions. \n\nFrom 1944 till the end of the war, 21,048 units of the following two main modifications were produced:\n\nT-34-85 (D-5T) - the first serial version with 85 mm D-5T-85 gun, gun length 48.8 calibers.\nT-34-85 (ZIS-S-53) - new 85 mm ZIS-S-53 gun (model 1944), gun length 54.6 calibers.\n\nThe T-34-85 tanks took part in the final World War II operations, including the Quantun army rout. These tanks formed the backbone of the Soviet Army tank fleet in the first post-war years.\n\nIt is known that the tank is still used by some countries to this very day.\n

The IS-2 ("Iosif Stalin") was developed in summer 1943 in parallel with the heavy IS-1, armed with an 85 mm gun. The IS-1 and IS-2 were based on the prototype KV-13 tank. Owing to thick armor and high firepower, the IS-2 became a formidable opponent for heavy German tanks. However, the IS-2 had some essential drawbacks that confined its anti-tank abilities: insufficient ammo and separate gun loading, which reduced rate of fire.\n\n3,483 units of the two main modifications were manufactured from December 1943 till June 1945:\n\nIS-1 - Basic model. 67 units with 85 mm D-5T gun.\nIS-2 - Main modification: a 122 mm gun. From mid-1944, the tanks of the series were produced with new inclined front armor. \n\nIn reality, the most powerful and complete serial heavy Soviet tank of the Second World War was the IS-3, which was used in battles against Japan in 1945 but was left out of operations against Nazi Germany. The first time the IS-3 was officially demonstrated to the Allies was on September 7 1945 at an Allied troop parade in Berlin. The tank was adopted in the USSR and other countries until the seventies.\n\n

The hull of the tank was made of welded rolled armor plates. The turret was produced in welded and cast versions. There were also two types of welded turrets - one with a right-angled and another one with a rounded rear. Serial production of the KV-1 started in February 1940 together with KV-2 production. The latter had a larger turret with a 152 mm howitzer installed.\n\n4,775 units of the following main modifications were produced from February 1940 till October 1943:\n\nKV-1 - The first serial version. From autumn 1941, front armor was increased from 75 to 105 mm. There was a 76 mm F-32 gun, but from autumn 1941 a 76 mm ZIS-5 was used. The lack of diesel engines at the beginning of the war resulted in equipping some of the tanks with 400 HP M-17 carburetor engines (294.5kW).\nKV-2 - New turret with 152 mm M-10 howitzer, 6-man crew. Weight: 52 tons.\nKV-1c - New streamlined cast turret and a small commander turret. Overall tank weight reduced due to optimized armor. Weight: 42.5 tons.\nKV-85 - New turret with 85 mm D-5T gun placed on KV-1c chassis. Weight: 46 tons.\nKV-8 - Flame-throwing tank. Created on the basis of the KV-1 and KV-1C. 76 mm gun replaced with 45 mm gun (1934 model) with masking jacket repeating the exterior shape of the 76 mm gun. ATO-41 flamethrower was installed near the machine-gun, shooting in the same direction as a gun.\n\nThe fate of the KV-1 was full of contradictions. When the war with the Soviet Union broke out, the tank was in fact unnecessary because at that time it had no adequate opponents. In comparison with the medium T-34 tank, it did not feature any obvious fighting advantages except thicker armor. The "Tiger" - a German tank of the same class as the KV-1 - became available only at the end of 1942, but the KV could not fight it because of its insufficient firepower. Nevertheless, heavy KV tanks took part in military operations in the Second World War until its final stages.\n

There was a new commander turret, thickened front armor, improved ventilation of the battle compartment and strengthened suspension of the front wheels.\n\nThe SU-100 was used by the Red Army in the battles of the 1944 autumn-winter campaign and in the final stages of the war in 1945. The SU-100 was used on a fairly large scale while repelling the German counter-offensive at Lake Balaton (Hungary) in March 1945. In other sectors of the front, the SU-100 was rather scarce.\n\nFrom July 3 1944 to June 1945, 2,495 units were produced.\n\nThis successful SPA was produced in the USSR till 1947; later on it was produced under license in many other countries. The SU-100 was adopted by dozens of countries till the eighties. \n

isu152_NAME         ISU-152
isu152_INFO         \n    ISU-152 (1943 model)\n\nType: Self-Propelled Artillery\nCrew: Five\nArmament: 152  mm ML-20S howitzer gun. Some of the vehicles came with a 12.7  mm anti-aircraft machine-gun.\nAmmo: 20 shells.\nArmor: front, sides - 90  mm, rear - 60  mm, roof and bottom - 20 to 30 mm.\nMax Speed: 35 km/h \nRange: 220 km\nEngine: V-2-IS, 520 HP (382.5kW), diesel, liquid cooled.\nWeight: 46 tons\n\nThe heavy anti-tank self-propelled ISU-152 gun was based on the IS tank and was intended primarily for destroying enemy fortification works and reinforced positions. However, like the SU-152 (the production of which was stopped abruptly because production of the basic KV-1C tank was interrupted), the ISU performed well as a tank-destroyer. This self-propelled gun was known to the troops as the Zveroboy ("Animal Hunter"). A shell fragment fired from its 52 mm gun was enough to tear off the turret of a heavy Tiger tank. \n\nFrom November 1943 till July 1945 about 4,700 units were produced with the following modifications:\nISU -152 - The chassis of the basic tank was left with virtually no modifications. An armored crew compartment was situated in the front of the vehicle, the front plate of which was taken up by an ML-20S howitzer gun.\nISU-122 - Identical to the ISU-152 in construction. Armed with 122 mm A-19 corps gun (1931/37 model) with piston lock.\nISU-122S - Armed with D-25S 122 mm gun (1943 model). Increased hull size.\n

Many were passed to the Soviet Red Army and to British forces through the Lend-Lease program and gave good use wherever they fought. They were reliable and mobile, impressively so, especially when measured against older style light armor, and were used in all theatres of combat during the war.  As WW2 went on, they became less used, and by 1944 were considered obsolete for combat with many being converted to command and reconnaissance vehicles with the turrets removed and additional machine-guns added instead.  Many variants of the Stuart were produced including mine-clearing, flame-throwing and anti-aircraft versions.  They served well until newer, better vehicles could be put into production and made available on the front lines.\n\n\n\n

M5A1Stuart_INFO     \nM5 Stuart, 1942\n\nType: Light Tank\nCrew: 4\nArmament: 37mm Mg gun, 2 x .30 cal Browning MG M1919A4\nAmmo: 147 rounds 37mm,  6750 rounds .30 cal\nArmor:  Hull Front 67mm, Hull Side 29mm, Hull Rear 25mm\n\tTurret Front 44mm, Turret Side 32mm, Turret Rear 32\n\tTop Deck 13mm\nMax Speed: 58 km/h\nRange: 161 km\nEngine: Cadillac Twin V8 220hp\nWeight:  15,500kg.\n\nThe M5 was an evolution of the M3 Stuart light tank incorporating the best features of the M3 with a new Cadlilac engine and transmission.  To accommodate the new powerplant, the rear deck was stepped up.  Other improvements over the M3 included sloped armor and a better layout for the crew.  The glacis plate of the M5 was sloped at 42 degrees and offered far better protection against armor piercing rounds compared with the flat plate of the early M3s. The M5A1 had an improved radio installation which resulted in a large rear turret overhang.  6810 M5s and M5A1s were produced.\n\nThe M5 was insufficiently armed for use against German armor in Europe and was restricted to the reconnaissance role in that theatre.   In the Pacific the M5 was still useful as a general combat tank.   The M5s 37mm gun was very capable of defeating any Japanese armor encountered.   In addition to high explosive and armor piercing rounds, the M5 was armed with canister rounds.   These were, in effect, large shotgun shells and were very effective against exposed infantry at close range.  M5s in the Pacific were typically deployed with M3 Satan flamethrower tanks to lend additional fire support and defend against Japanese armor and anti-tank guns.\n\nVariants included the M5 command tank, the M5 E7-7 flame gun tank, and the T8 reconnaissance vehicle without turret.  The major foreign users of the M5 were the British and the Free French.  The Soviet Union only received five M5 tanks. \n\n\n\n\n

It utilized an efficient bell-crank suspension which, combined with its V-12 diesel engine gave it good all-around performance.   The turret and hull were of riveted construction.   The Chi-Has main gun however, was a low velocity piece of very little use against enemy tanks.   To compound this deficiency, elevation control of the main guns was controlled simply by resting on the gunners shoulder.   This made precise aiming extremely difficult.   In 1941 production began of the updated Shinhoto Chi-Ha which had a much improved 47mm L/48 anti-tank gun with mechanical elevation control.\n\nThe Chi-Ha was used by the Japanese on all major fronts.    In the Pacific the Chi-Ha played a significant role in the Japanese breakthrough at Malay Peninsula and the subsequent taking of Singapore.  The largest Japanese tank assault of the Pacific war was led by Chi-Has at Saipan in June 1944.   Attacking Type 97 medium and Type 95 light tanks were met with fire from M4 Shermans, 37mm AT guns and bazookas and were slaughtered.  Even the Shinhoto Chi-Ha with its 47mm AT gun was no match for the American M4 Sherman, its primary opponent and did very little to slow the American advance through the Pacific.\n\n\n

Like its predecessor, the Pz.I, the Pz.II was primarily intended for personnel training and the creation of battle groups for tank divisions. The Pz.II was a more fully-fledged military car than the Pz.I and, because of the lack of Pz.Kpfw.III and IV vehicles in Wehrmacht tank divisions, it was delivered to Panzerwaffen military units and took part in all campaigns during the initial period of the Second World War.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1941 1,542 Pz.II units of all types were manufactured.\n \nMain modifications:\n  \nPz.Kpfw.II Ausf. A1, A2, A3, b, and c - First serial tanks. There was a slight difference between them. Maybach HL 57T\u0420 engine, 130 HP (95.6kW). Weight: 7.6 tons. \nPz.Kpfw.II Ausf. B - New Maybach HL 62TRM engine, 140 HP (103kW). Weight: 9.5 tons.\nPz.Kpfw.II Ausf. A - Modifications of tank transmission. New type of driver's observation device.\nPz.Kpfw.II Ausf. B - Technology modifications to simplify serial production.\nPz.Kpfw.II Ausf. C - Tanks of this modification came with a better system for engine cooling and 50 mm armored glass in observation devices (cf. with 12 mm in A and B). \nPz.Kpfw.II Ausf. D, E - New hull and running gear. Weight: 10 tons. Max Speed - 58 km/h.\nPz.Kpfw.II Ausf. F - New hull construction. Strengthened armor protection. New 20 mm KwK 38 tank gun. Weight: 9.5 tons.\nPz.Kpfw.II Ausf. G (VK 901) - New hull and running gear with five bearing rollers placed in chess-like order. Armor: 14.5 - 30 mm. Engine: Maybach HL 45p 150 HP (110.4kW). Max Speed: 50 km/h. Weight: 9.2 tons.\nPz.Kpfw.II Ausf. J - Developed like Pz.II n.A. ("neue Art": new model). New case, turret and running gear. Powerful armor: 50-80 mm. Speed: 31km/h. \nPz.Kpfw.II Ausf. L "Luchs" ("Lynx") - Improved and modernized variant of the VK 901 model. Light reconnaissance tank. Increased fighting ability. Four-man crew. Engine: Maybach HL 66p 200 HP (147.2kW). Max. speed: 60 km/h. Weight: 11.8 tons. \n\nThe Pz.II tanks received their baptism of fire during the civil war in Spain. On June 22 1941, the Panzerwaffe had 746 such tanks suitable for military operations against the USSR. 424 tanks had already been lost in bitter conflicts by the end of 1941. The Pz.II were used till 1943. 70 Pz.II tanks took part in the Citadel operation. In March 1945, the troops had 145 units of this type of tank at their disposal. \n\nThe Pz.II served as the basis for producing self-propelled artillery guns, field engineering, bridge and flame throwing vehicles.\n\n

The medium Pz.III tank was the first proper battle tank the Wehrmacht had at its disposal. It was developed as a vehicle for platoon commanders; however, from 1940 till 1943 it was the main medium tank used by the Germans.\nPz.III production was stopped in 1943 after about 6,000 vehicles had been produced. Later on, they were used merely as a basis for production of self-propelled artillery.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nPz.Kpfw.III Ausf. A - Pre-serial version. Chassis consists of 5 driving wheels of large diameter and two supporting wheels of smaller size. Armament: 37 mm KwK L/46,5 gun and three MG34 machine-guns. Engine: Maybach HL 108TR 250 HP (183.9kW). Max Speed: 32 km/h. Weight: 15.4 tons.\nPz.Kpfw.III Ausf. B - New running gear with eight bearing wheels of smaller diameter and suspension on laminated springs. Commander turret unified with Pz.IV Ausf.A.\nPz.Kpfw.III Ausf. C - Differs slightly from the previous model. Some modifications introduced in suspension.\nPz.Kpfw.III Ausf. D - Front and side armor thickened to 30 mm. Some modifications introduced in suspension.\nPz.Kpfw.III Ausf. E - Completely new running gear with six bearing wheels, torsion suspension. Two-fold side hatches in the turret, new placement of coaxial machine-gun. Modified hull rear. Armament remained. Engine: Maybach HL 120TR 300 HP (220.8kW). Max. speed: 40 km/h. Weight: 19.5 tons.\nPz.Kpfw.III Ausf. F - Slightly modernized version of the Pz.IIIE. Later on all Pz.IIIE and Pz.IIIF tanks were re-equipped with a 50 mm KwK 38 gun. The number of machine-guns was reduced to two.\nPz.Kpfw.III Ausf. G - Slight modifications of the hull details. New commander turret with five observation appliances. Armament: 50 mm KwK 38 gun and two MG 34 machine-guns. Maybach HL 120TRM 300 HP (220.8kW). Weight: 20.3 tons. \nPz.Kpfw.III Ausf. G (trop) - Pz.IIIG for use in the torrid zone. It had a better cooling system and air filters. \n\nThe Pz.Kpfw.III was used in all theaters of military operations - from the Eastern front to the African deserts - and was much loved by the German tank men, far and wide. The working conditions created for the tank crew could be considered a model for imitation. They were superior to anything that Soviet, English or American tanks could offer at that time. Perfect observation and aiming appliances enabled the Pz.III to fight successfully against the more powerful T-34, KV and Mathildas in situations where the latter failed to discover them in time. Captured Pz.III tanks were the favorite command vehicles in the Red Army due to the features specified above. However, like other German tanks, Soviet tank men also used them efficiently in battle, the purpose for which they had been intended.\n\nThe Pz.III served as the basis for various self-propelled artillery guns, five types of command tanks, flame throwing tanks, vehicles of front artillery observers and recovery vehicles.\n\n

The front and rear of the vehicle were protected with 50 mm armor. Side and turret armor was 30 mm thick. Armor protection of the gun mount increased by 20 mm. Among other slight improvements, the most essential was the new type of MG 34 machine-gun that was installed.\n\nInitially, Pz.IIIJ tanks were armed with 50 mm KwK 38 L/42 tank guns, but from December 1941 they received new 50 mm KwK 39 main guns with barrels 60 calibers long.\n\nIn all, 1,549 vehicles with KwK 38 L/42 guns were produced, and 1,067 vehicles with KwK 39 L/60 guns.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nPz.Kpfw.III Ausf.

The Pz.IIIM tanks differed slightly from the L version. NbKWg 90 mm smoke grenade launchers were placed on two sides of the turret, and a counterweight  KwK 39 L/60 gun was mounted. Escape hatches in hull sides were eliminated. All this made it possible to enlarge ammo capacity from 84 to 98 rounds. The tanks exhaust system allowed it to cross 1.3m deep-water obstacles without preparation. Other improvements involved the form of the tow hooks, moving lights, the mounting of an anti-aircraft machine-gun and fastening holders for additional armor screens.\n\nThe initial order was for 1,000 new machines, but in view of the advantage the Soviet tanks had over the Pz.III with its 50 mm gun, this number was reduced to 250 vehicles. Some other tanks were rebuilt into StuG III self-propelled guns and Pz.III (Fl) flame-throwing tanks, while others were redesigned into the N version with 75 mm guns.\n\n

Their production required a 47 and 213 chassis and turrets for both versions. The main distinguishing feature of the Pz.IIIN was its 75 mm KwK 37 L/24 gun, with which the A-F1 versions of the Pz.Kpfw.IV tank were armored. Ammo was up to 64 rounds. The Pz.IIIN had a modified gun mount and a one-piece hatch for the commander turret, which had 100 mm of armor. The observation slot to the right of the gun was eliminated. Apart from that, there were a number of other inessential features distinguishing the vehicle from earlier models.\n\nProduction of N modification tanks started in June 1942 and continued till August 1943. Total number produced: 663 vehicles, and another 37 tanks were re-equipped while repairing vehicles of other versions to meet Ausf.N V standards.\n\n\n

This would include forming the new armored corps equipped with Hungarian-built tanks. However the Hungarian designers were not able to create their own tank design neither before nor during the war. \n\nThe Turan medium tank was named after the historical Madyar (Hungarian) homeland located in Middle Asia from where they moved to Europe in the early 6th century. The tank was based on the Czech T-21 tank from the Skoda company. The Turan had several notable differences: The Czech 47-mm A11 cannon was replaced with a 40-mm Hungarian cannon; the tank received a new engine, new improved armor, new optics and communications equipment. Over than that, the tank hull basically remained the same with the exception of the commanders turret. From 1944 on, the Turan tanks received steel armor skirts that protected it from cumulative damage. \n\nThe Turan I tanks participated in heavy fighting against the Red Army in East Poland, Transylvania, Hungary, Austria and the Czechoslovakia. \n\nApproximately 285 Turan I tanks were produced between April 1942 and May 1944.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nTuran I  Base production model.\nTuran I P.K.  Commanders tank with smaller ammo load and an improved R/4T radio.\n\n\n

The main area of improvement was to be the firepower, which involved installing a 75-mm 41M cannon from the MAVAG factory. Due to the larger cannon, the tank turret also needed to be redesigned. The hull and the running gear remained virtually unchanged, but the tanks speed decreased due to the increased weight. By February of 1942, the improved Turan was successfully tested in the field, and the new tank was put into large-scale production, receiving the name Turan II. \n\nTuran II tanks were used together with Turan I tanks. \n\nAltogether, some 140 Turan II tanks were produced between mid-1942 and June of 1944.\n\n\n

It was adopted as a vehicle by the BW tank battalion commanders (Batailonsfuhrerwagen). It was the most co mmon mass-produced tank the Wehrmacht had at its disposal and the only German tank for which serial production continued through the Second World War. Produced by Krupp, Vomag and Niebelungenwerke. From 1937 to 1945, 8,500 tanks were made.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nPz.Kpfw.IV Ausf. A - "Zero series". Armament: 75 mm KwK 37 gun with barrel 24 caliber long and two MG 34 machine-guns. Armor 10 to 30 mm thick. Engine: Maybach HL 108TR 250 HP (184kW). Weight: 17.3 tons.\nPz.Kpfw.IV Ausf. B - This modification had a straight front hull plate. The coaxial machine-gun was not installed. New commanders turret. Engine: Maybach HL 120TR 300 HP (220.8kW).\nPz.Kpfw.IV Ausf. C - Differs slightly from the previous modification. A special change was made under the main gun barrel, which turned the wireless station antenna at the turn of the turret. Some of the vehicles had the Maybach HL 120TRM 300 HP (220.8kW) engine.\nPz.Kpfw.IV Ausf. D - Front part of the hull as in Pz.IVA, including coaxial machine-gun. Modified gun mount. In 1940-1941, front armor was strengthened with a 20 mm armor plate.\nPz.Kpfw.IV Ausf. E - Front armor of the hull 30 mm thick plus an additional 30 mm armor plate. Front armor of the turret - 30m, gun mount - 35 - 37 mm. New commander turret and ball mounting of machine-gun. Weight: 21 tons.\n\nThe Pz.IV took part in all military operations, beginning with the seizure of the Sudet region and ending with the battle for Berlin in 1945. On the eve of the incursion into Poland, the army had 211 Pz.IV tanks, and just before beginning military operations in the West they had 290. These tanks were, for the most part, concentrated in divisions operating in the main directional thrust of attacks.\n\nBy the beginning of operation Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht had 439 Pz.IV tanks. Armed with short-barreled guns, they could hardly oppose Soviet light and heavy tanks. The situation evened up only when a long-barreled modification appeared. By the middle of 1943, the Pz.IV became the main German tank on the Eastern front. It made up 40 percent of the tanks taking part in the Citadel operation battles.\n\nIn North Africa, right up until the capitulation of the German forces, the Pz.IV successfully resisted all types of Allied tanks. \n\nThe Pz.IV was used as the basis for making self-propelled artillery guns, command tanks, vehicles of front artillery observers, evacuation tractors and bridge tanks.\n\nAfter the war, the Pz.IV were adopted in Finland (till 1962) and Syria (till 1967).\n\n

Tanks of the F series were constructed not only in Krupp factories, but also in Vomag factories. In contrast to the vehicles of A, D and E modifications, the Pz.IVF had a whole front plate 50 mm thick. The MG 34 machine-gun was placed in a ball mounting. The armor of the hull sides and turret was now 30 mm thick. Front turret armor was 50 mm thick, while the rear was 20 mm. Additional ventilation apertures appeared on the lid of the power compartment as well as on hatches enabling access to the gearbox and brake drums at the front of the tank. Side turret doors consisted of two parts. There was an observation slot on the doors made of armored glass and a small shooting hatch used for turret ventilation. On the left of the rear there was an armored jacket for a smoke releasing device. The barrel of the gun, front dashboards and front towing hook were also slightly modified. Some changes were introduced into the construction of the front armored turret plate and an anti-rain protection shield appeared above the doors of the turret. The gun mount armor was strengthened to 50 mm. Air inflow channels on the engine were equipped with standard bolts. \n\nWhen the Pz.IV armed with a long-barreled gun was adopted, the vehicles bearing KwK 37 L/24 guns of 75 mm caliber were marked Ausf.F1. New tanks were marked Ausf.F2.\n\nThe total number produced from April 1941 to March 1942 came to 462 units of the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.F tank.\n\n

This tank gun was designed for mounting in the next Pz.IV modifications because a short-barreled gun with low initial shell velocity did not ensure good armor piercing at long distances. The first serial Pz.IVF2 tanks with long-barreled guns rolled out of the workshop in March-July 1942. Tank ammo was 87 rounds. The vehicles were equipped with an improved TZF 5f sight, modified gun mount and a new design of turret hatches. Fighting weight was 23.67 tons. Some of the tanks belonging to a later series had a turret from the G version tanks.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nPz.Kpfw.IV Ausf. F2 - 75 mm KwK 40 gun with barrel 43 calibers long. Weight: 23.67 tons.\nPz.Kpfw.IV Ausf. G - Tanks produced later were armed with a 75 mm KwK 40 gun with barrel 48 calibers long and had an additional 30 mm armored plate in the front of the hull.\nPz.Kpfw.IV Ausf. H - 75 mm KwK 40 gun with barrel 48 calibers long. Wireless station antenna moved from the side to the rear. 5 mm anti-cumulative screens were installed.

From June 1944 till March 1945, Nibelungen produced 2,892 vehicles of this type. In comparison to the previous H version, Pz.IVJ tanks were technologically simplified. They had no additional engine to power the turret drive and, as a result, the turret of the J version tank was rotated with a hand crank. Turret hatch construction was simplified and there were no more side visors for the driver on the tank front - after installation of additional armored plates, they were no longer necessary. All-metal supporting rollers and guide wheels of a new type were now used for the running gear. Fuel tank capacity increased to 189 cc which increased range to 320 km. J version tanks produced in late 1944-early 1945 were equipped with armored screens made of wire mesh which protected the hull and running gear from cumulative shells. Vehicles of the same modification had slight differences of detail in peripherals, the arrangement of instrument boxes and spare parts. \n

However, when the T-34 and KV tanks appeared on the Eastern front, the Germans had to speed up their efforts to create a tank that would be comparable to them in fighting power. On November 25 1941, Daimler-Benz and MAN were ordered to design such a tank. The MAN project won acceptance. By September 1942, MAN was ready with the first prototype, and in January 1943 the first serial tanks rolled out of the factory workshops. These were Pz.V Ausf.D vehicles - they differed slightly from the prototype. In August-September 1943, production of the new Pz.V Ausf.A modification was launched. The most significant changes were the introduction of a coaxial machine-gun ball mounting, a new design of commander turret, the removal of a small hatch on the left side of the turret and pistol loopholes.\n\nIn March 1944, serial production of the Ausf.G modification was launched. The driver's cork-hatch was removed from the front plate of the hull. The sides were given an inclination of 61 degrees instead of 50 degrees for the D and A versions. Tanks of all modifications were provided with bulwarks. Development of the new AusfF version Panther started in the second half of 1944. The most essential Ausf.F. novelty was a new type of turret - the Schmalturm ("narrow turret"). This turret was a bit smaller than the standard one and had different armor. There was a gun mount of the "snout" type. The front armor of this turret was 120 to 125 mm thick, and the sides and rear were 60 mm thick. The changes affected the hull as well: the thickness of armor on its roof was 35 mm; new hatches for the driver and coaxial machine-gunner to board were introduced.\n\nWork on designing the Panther II tank was based on the idea of unifying the designs of the Tiger II and the Panther. The same Schmalturm was to be mounted on it, but with an 88 mm KwK 43 L/71 gun.\n\nIn all, by May 1945 over 6.000 Panther tanks of all modifications were produced.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nPz.Kpfw.V Ausf.D - The first version weighing 43 tons. Armament: 75 mm KwK 42 gun with a barrel 70 calibers long. Maybach HL 230\u0420\u0417O engine, with 700 HP (514.5kW) power. Armor: 16 to 100 mm thick. Vehicles produced later had a new type of commander turret. \nPz.Kpfw.V Ausf.A - Ball mounting of coaxial machine-gun. The new designed did away with the hatch for dumping cartridge-cases and loopholes for shooting personal firearms in the sides of the turret. The binocular sight was swapped for a monocular one. The elevation angle of the gun was reduced.\nPz.Kpfw.V Ausf.G - Changed inclination of side armored plates, abolished cork-hatch in the front plate of the case. Changes introduced to the engine system. Some of the vehicles were produced with bearing rollers without rubber tires.   \nPz.Kpfw.V Ausf.F - New Schmalturm turret. Enlarged hull armor. Armament left without changes.\n\nPanther II -Schmalturm turret with 88 mm KwK 43 L/71 gun.\n\nPanthers took active part in military operations on all fronts of the Second World War. It was the second most co mmon mass-produced German tank and became the main and the most serious opponent of Allied tanks in the closing stages of the war.\n\nPanther tanks served as the basis for creating self-propelled artillery, recovery vehicles, command tanks and vehicles for front artillery observers.\n\n

However the first two prototypes of the Tiger proper - the VK 3601(H) - were produced by Henschel in March 1942. Its weight was 40 tons. However, Adolf Hitler wanted the armor protection to be enhanced and two prototypes - the VK 4501(H), made by Henschel, and the VK 4501(P), made by Porsche - were ready by his birthday on April 20 1942. The only similar feature they had was the Krupp-made turret. The Henschel vehicle was acknowledged to be better. The tank was marked Pz.Kpfw. VI "Tiger" Ausf.H1, and, after the adoption of the Tiger II in 1944, it was called Tiger Ausf. E, or Tiger I. \n\nIn August 1942, Henschel started serial production of heavy Tiger tanks. The first serial vehicles were almost identical to the VK 4501(H) prototype: only the turret went through slight modifications (it now had a toolbox attached and an additional gunner hatch on the rear). The tanks produced from the middle of 1943 were covered with zimmerit. In the course of serial production, the Tiger underwent some changes, such as the installation of automatic fire-prevention equipment. In all, 1,355 Tiger tanks were produced from September 1942 to August 1944 by the Henschel and Wegman factories.\n\nTigers were used in offensive actions on all fronts till the end of the war. It was the first heavy tank at the Wehrmacht's disposal and naturally they produced it in ample quantities. The tank was second to none in armament power and armor protection until the Soviet IS-2 appeared.\n\nThe Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.E was sent to heavy tank battalions. It was used for the first time in autumn 1942 on the Leningrad front as part of the 502nd heavy tank battalion. Two months later, Tigers from the 501st heavy tank battalion rolled into battle in North Africa.\n\n181 Pz.Kpfw.VIAusf.E Tiger tanks took part in the Citadel operation in su mmer 1943. In July, Soviet troops wiped out 34 Tigers.\n\nThe Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.E was used as the basis for constructing self-propelled artillery, command tanks and evacuation tractors.  \n \n

The order for heavy tank development was submitted to Porsche and Henschel. Both delivered projects to the German tank department, and the Henschel design was chosen. That project was to a large extent based on technical solutions used before in the construction of the Pz.Kpfw. VI "Tiger" Ausf. H1. However, the first 50 tanks were equipped with cast turrets of Porsche design, which had already been in production by that time. Subsequent vehicles had cast turrets of simpler construction (developed by Henschel).\n\nThe Tiger II or King Tiger was the most powerful German tank to take part in World War II. It was distinguished by its optimal thickness correlation of front armor and turret armor. Direct fire from its 88 mm gun penetrated armor on all types of tanks. The Tiger represented a massive and formidable battle vehicle. Developed specifically to win superiority on the battlefield, it could be very effective if the crew knew how to put its fighting ability to good use. Of all the tanks constructed during World War II, it was the heaviest and the best-protected and armed vehicle. Even these days, its armor and gun would be the pride of any main battle tank.\n\nHenschel and Wegman produced 487 Tiger II tanks from October 1943 to March 1945.\n\nThe Tiger II was supplied to heavy tank battalions instead of the Pz.VIE. In some military units both tanks were adopted. On the Eastern front, the Tiger II was first used on August 13 1944 during an attack on Stashuv (in Poland, the Sandomirsky bridgehead area).\n\nAviation was the main means of combating King Tigers on the Western front because the latter were high-powered and effective in combat.\n\nThe Pz.VIB was used as the basis for constructing self-propelled artillery guns and command tanks.\n

It was based on the Turan medium tank. The Zrinyi was different from the base tank in that the hull was widened. The transmission, running gear and engine remained the same. A redesigned 105 mm 40M infantry field gun was installed in the compact well-armored turret.\n\nFrom 1944 on, the Zrinyi assault guns were equipped with 8-mm armor skirts that protected the SPA from cumulative damage.\n\nDespite its obsolete technology, the Zrinyi became the most successful Hungarian armored vehicle of WWII. \n\nZrinyi II assault guns were used in fighting in East Galicia, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. \n\nApproximately 66 Zrinyi II SPA were built in 1943 and 1944. \n\n\n

It was specially designed for the Eastern front. The Ferdinand design was based on the Tiger-VK4501(P) prototype, which had failed to pass muster because of technical problems with the electro-mechanic transmission, yielding to Henschels Tiger-VK4501(H) prototype. On September 22, it was decided to transform 90 ready-made chassis into heavy assault tanks armed with 88 mm PaK 43/2 L/71 guns and, on November 30 1942, the first prototype was ready. On March 19 1943, the first complete Ferdinand was demonstrated to Adolf Hitler on the Ruegenwalde testing area. Hitler was very pleased with the new tank and ordered its production to be speeded up, using all possible means, before the impending summer offensives on the fronts.\n\nFrom April to May 1943, 90 chassis of the VK4501(P) prototype were used to produce the Ferdinand tank at the Nibelungenwerke factory in St. Valentin, Austria. Re-equipment included a number of modifications: two original Porsche Typ 101/1 engines were replaced with Maybach HL 120TRM. New engines were installed in the central part of the hull so that the Alkett-produced superstructure could be placed behind. Additional armored plates were fastened to the hull with bolts. Ferdinand (named after Dr. Ferdinand Porsche) was armed with a powerful 88 mm PaK 43/2 L/71 gun and had very thick armor, from 80 mm on the sides to 200 mm on the front. A 7.92 mm MG 34 machine-gun was placed inside the hull for use by the crew.\n\nOn May 8 1943, all 90 Ferdinands left the factory and were sent to the Eastern front. \n\nIn October 1943, the Ferdinands that had managed to escape destruction in military operations were sent back to the factory for major repairs and scheduled modification. Modernization included installing a 7.92 mm MG 34 machine-gun within the case, improving armor protection, putting on wider caterpillars and a commander turret (from Pz.III tanks) for better visibility. Most Ferdinands were partially covered with zimmerit. Modified Ferdinands were rechristened "Elefant" ("Elephant"). \nThe Ferdinands received their baptism of fire on the Kursk Salient, as part of the 653rd and 654th tank destroyer divisions. Each of these had 45 units. After modernization, all vehicles became part of 653rd tank destroyer division and fought in Italy. In the winter of 1945, the Elephants took part in the German counterattack in the Ardennes. At the end of March, 28 battle vehicles of this type were reckoned to be still in operation. \n\n\n

minaS_INFO          \n    7.5cm Panzerjager 38(t) "Hetzer" - "Hunter"\n\nType: Tank Destroyer\nCrew: Four\nArmament: Pak 39 L/48 75 mm gun, 7.92 mm MG 34 (or MG 42) machine-gun.\nAmmo: 41 shells; 1,200 rounds.\nArmor: front - 60 mm, sides - 20 mm, rear - 20 mm, roof - 20 mm, bottom - 10 mm.\nMax Speed: 42 km/h.\nRange: 260 km.\nEngine: Praga AC/2800 160 HP (117kW), carburetor, liquid cooled.\nWeight: 16 tons\n\nAfter the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia, they got their hands on a large number of excellent Czech TNHP (LT-38) tanks, which were adopted by the Wehrmacht under the marking Pz.38(t). But, in 1943, the Pz.38(t) was beginning to become outdated, although its chassis was still a wonderful achievement of engineering design. This was the reason why the Germans used the Pz.38(t) chassis as the basis for developing new types of light armored vehicles. In December 1943, the prototype of a light well-armored tank destroyer based on the Pz.38(t) was ready. After the tests were over (the results surpassed all expectations) the new vehicle was adopted under the name of "Hetzer" ("Hunter").\n\nIn 1944 and 1945, B MM and Skoda produced 2,849 vehicles of this type.\nHetzer turned out to be the best light anti-tank self-propelled vehicle of the Second World War. The vehicle had a completely new low frame characterized by the considerable inclination of the front, side and rear armored plates. Because of the weight increase, in comparison with the basic Pz.38(t) tank, the running gear was strengthened and widened. In fact, only the transmission and running gear set were borrowed from the basic tank. An MG 34 remote control machine-gun appeared on the roof of the frame. The 75 mm gun was covered with a "snout" type mask.\n\nThe Hetzer received its baptism of fire in July 1944. The vehicle was used on all fronts till the last days of the war.\n\nThe Hetzer self-propelled vehicle served as the basis for producing 20 flame-throwing tanks, 30 self-propelled vehicles with 150 mm infantry gun sIG 33 and 170 recovery vehicles.\n\nWhen the Second World War was over, the Hetzer was adopted by the Czechoslovakian army right up to the early fifties and by the Swiss army till the seventies.\n

minaT_NAME          Jagdpanther
minaT_INFO          \n    8.8cm Jagdpanzer V JAGDPANTHER\n\nType: Tank Destroyer\nCrew: Five\nArmament: Pak 43/3 L/71 gun of 88 mm caliber, 7.92 mm MG 34 machine-gun. \nAmmo: 57 shells; 1,200 rounds.\nArmor: front - 80 mm, sides - 50 mm, rear - 40 mm, roof - 25 mm, bottom - 16 mm.\nMax Speed: 55 km/h.\nRange: 210 km. \nEngine: Maybach HL 230 P30 600 HP (441kW), carburetor, liquid cooled.\nWeight: 45.5 tons\n\nOne of the most powerful and undoubtedly the most successful German anti-tank self-propelled artillery gun of World War II. Developed by MIAG and based on the Panther tank. The first model was demonstrated to Adolf Hitler on October 20 1943 and was immediately approved by him. A crew compartment with good ballistic profile was placed on the chassis of the tank. A large gun crossed the battle compartment, dividing it in two. The Panther control system made it easy to turn the hull to ensure precision aiming, and the guns armor-piercing shells could pierce 193 mm armor at a distance of 1,000m. To the left of the gun there was an MG 34 machine-gun in a ball mounting. If we take into consideration the fact that the Jagdpanther always had to face the opponent with powerful front armor, it was clearly a terrifying weapon.\n\nIn 1944-1945, MIAG and MNH factories produced 392 vehicles.\n\nThe first vehicle shipments to the troops started in February 1944. They were adopted only by heavy destroyer-anti-tank units and were under the command of the largest formations: as a rule these were armies fighting in the battles on the most important fronts.\nJagdpanther production was limited and military units did not receive many of them. This was just as well for the Allied forces, because it was one of the most powerful and unquestionably the most successful German anti-tank self-propelled artillery guns and a very effective means of fighting Soviet and Allied tanks.\n\nThe Jagdpanther tank-destroyer was employed on all fronts till the end of the war. On March 1 1945, 202 vehicles were still operating.\n\n

minaU_NAME          StuG IIIG
minaU_INFO          \n    Sturmgeschutz III Ausf.G (Sd.Kfz.142) - StuG IIIG\n\nType: Assault Gun/Tank Destroyer\nCrew: Four\nArmament: Stuk 40 L/48 gun of 75 mm caliber, 7.92 mm MG 34 machine-gun. \nAmmo: 54 shells, 600 rounds.\nArmor: hull and crew compartment front - 80 mm, sides and rear - 30 mm, roof - 17-18, bottom - 19 mm.\nMax Speed: 40 km/h.\nRange: 155 km.\nEngine: Maybach HL 120TRM 300 HP (220.6kW), carburetor, liquid cooled.\nWeight: 23.4 tons\n\nThe German army's most common mass-produced armored assault gun during World War II. It was designed as an assault gun for infantry support. The base was the chassis of the Pz.III tank. As a rule, the StuG III was a fairly successful assault weapon and was used in this capacity and as a tank-destroyer, an offensive and defensive weapon on all fronts. All versions of Stug III had a low profile (a major requirement for the vehicle was that it would not exceed the height of an average person). This made them a difficult target and a dangerous opponent. Their crews were considered to be the elite of the German armored forces and had their own gray-khaki uniform (a variant on the standard tank uniform). The Stug III destroyed a large number of enemy tanks. After they were armed with a long-barreled gun in 1942, they became the main anti-tank instrument of the Wehrmacht.\n\nFrom February 1940 to April 1945, Alkett and MIAG factories produced over 10,500 StuG III assault weapons of all modifications.   \n\nMain modifications:\n\nStuG III Ausf.A - The first version of the Pz.IIIE/F chassis. A short-barreled 75 mm Stuk 37 L/24 gun was mounted in a low-profile armored fighting compartment at the front of the hull. The front armor of the hull and crew compartment was 50 mm thick. Crew: Four. All members of the crew, including the mechanical engineer, were positioned in the crew compartment. In contrast to the basic tank, there are no hatches in the sides of the case. Engine, transmission and running gear were left unchanged. Weight: 19.6 tons. 30 units produced.\n\nThe open crew compartment was considered a huge advantage in 1939, as the crew were not confined to using visor slots to spot the enemy. Instead, they could look over the side and see clearly around the vehicle. They were also able to hear enemy tanks and vehicles.\n\nStuG III Ausf.B -Pz.IIIH tank taken for a base. The engine, transmission and running gear were left without modifications. Hatches on hull sides remained. The form of the armored crew compartment and armament remained as in the StuG IIIA. Weight: 22 tons. 320 units produced.\nStuG III Ausf.C - A modified form of the front crew compartment fore-part and boarding hatches for gun layer and driver the acco mmodate the introduction of a new periscope sight made by Krupp. 100 units produced.\nStuG III Ausf.D - No structural differences with the previous variant. This mark was used for vehicles of the fifth production series. 150 units produced.\nStuG III Ausf.E - Modifications pertained to the construction of the armored crew compartment for the most part. Ammo increased from 44 to 50 artillery rounds. Communication pipes were abandoned in favor of an intercom device. 284 units produced.\nStuG III Ausf.F (Sd.Kfz.142/1) - 75 mm Stuk 40 L/43 gun. Ammo increased to 54 artillery rounds. Electric fan installed on crew compartment roof. 182 units of late issue featured increased front armor of crew compartment and hull (80 mm) at the expense of fastening additional armored plates with bolts. Weight: 23.2 tons. 364 units produced.\nStuG 40 Ausf.F/8 (Sd.Kfz.142/1) - Fundamental changes in hull construction, identical to those introduced on the Pz. III J and L tank cases. Gun: Stuk 40 L/48. Rear armor increased from 30 to 50 mm. 334 units produced.\nStuG 40 Ausf.G (Sd.Kfz.142/1) - Some modifications in construction of the crew compartment roof. Commander turret and rigid mounting of defensive MG 34 machine-gun covered with a protective shield on some of the cars. New "Saukopfblende" ("Snout") cast gun mount introduced on self-propelled artillery of later output. 8,071 units produced.\nStuH 42 (Sd.Kfz.142/2) - Identical construction to vehicles of the F, F8 and G variants. Armed with 105 mm StuH 42 1728 assault howitzer based on the design of the light leFH18 L/28field howitzer. Ammo: 36 artillery rounds. Crew: Four. Weight: 23.9 tons. 1,299 units produced.\n\nStuG III assault weapons received their baptism of fire in the course of the French campaign.\n\nDuring World War II, the StuG III was adopted by assault weapons battalions of motorized divisions and assault weapons companies (divisions) of infantry divisions. They were also adopted by anti-tank divisions and assault weapons brigades.\n\nOn the eve of war with the USSR, German troops had 377 assault weapons, 250 of which were concentrated on the Soviet Unions western border.\n455 StuG III and 68 StuH 42 tanks took part in the Citadel operation, accounting for 44% of all assault weapons on the Eastern front. They were also employed in North Africa, to the west and in Italy.\nThe StuG III served as a basis for a small number of ammo transporting and flame-throwing vehicles.\n\nIn the fifties StuG III tanks were adopted in Romania, Spain, Egypt and Syria. \n

minaV_INFO          \n    Sturmgeschutz IV (Sd.Kfz.163) - StuG IV\n\nType: Assault Gun/Tank Destroyer\nCrew: Four\nArmament: Stuk 40 L/48 gun of 75 mm caliber, 7.92 mm MG 34 machine-gun. \nAmmo: 63 shells, 600 rounds.\nArmor: front of the hull and crew compartment - 80 mm, rear and sides - 30 mm, roof - 17-18 mm, bottom - 19 mm.\nMax Speed: 38 km/h.\nRange: 210 km. \nEngine: Maybach HL 120TRM 300 HP (220.6kW), carburetor, liquid cooled.\nWeight: 23 tons\n\nStuG IV production was launched in December 1943. It was the result of successfully combining the StuG III armored crew compartment and the Pz.IV chassis. StuG IV assault weapons had standard armor for self-propelled StuG 40. Only the crew positioning was changed: the driver sat outside the main crew compartment on a special superstructure with periscope observation appliances and a boarding hatch located in the left part of the front case. February 1944 saw the first output of vehicles with the "snout" gun mount. Later on, an MG 34 machine-gun with distance-control was placed on the gun charger's hatch and a grenade cup discharge for shooting fission fragments was put on the case.\n\nFrom December 1943 to March 1945, Nibelungen and Krupp produced 1,139 such vehicles.\n\nStuG IV assault weapons were adopted by assault artillery military units and anti-tank units where they were used together with the self-propelled StuG III.\n\nAll variants of the StuG series demonstrated high battle efficiency and were very successfully employed on all fronts.\n\n

nimrod_NAME         Nimrod
nimrod_INFO         \n    Nimrod, 1942 model\n\nType: Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun\nCrew: Six\nArmament: 40-mm 36.M Bofors cannon.\nAmmo capacity: 148 shells.\nArmor: 13-mm frontal, 10-mm sides, 13-mm front turret, 6-7-mm top turret and lower hull.\nMax Speed: 60 km/h.\nRange:  250 km.\nEngine: L8V/36, 155 HP (114 kWt) water-cooled.\nWeight: 10.5 tons\n\nThe Nimrod anti-aircraft tank was named after the legendary ancestor of the Madyar and the Huns. As strange as it may seem, the Nimrod was originally intended to be a tank hunter. \n\nThe Nimrod was based on a license-built copy of the Swedish Toldi light tank. The Nimrods hull was made longer than the base model. Running gear was essentially the same, with the exception of a single roller added on each side. Transmission remained the same. The first production models used German engines; subsequent models had license-built engines made in Hungary. The Nimrod was armed with a single 40-mm Bofors automatic cannon, built under license as 36.M by the MAVAG factory. The Nimrod could use both armor piercing high explosive rounds and illumination flares in clips of four shells. \n\nThe Hungarian army received its first Nimrods in February of 1942. The tank proved ineffective against tanks, but was very valuable as an anti-aircraft weapon. Due to the compact and reliable design as well a very effective Bofors cannon (an improvement of which is still used today), the Nimrod became one of the most successful anti-aircraft tanks of WWII. \n\nNimrod anti-aircraft tanks were used on the Eastern Front from 1942 on, and also in Eastern Poland, Transylvania, Hungary, Austria and Czechoslovakia up until the end of the war. \n\nApproximately 178 Nimrod anti-aircraft tanks were produced from November 1941 to 1944. \n\n\n

minaW_NAME          Wirbelwind
minaW_INFO          \n    2cm Flak auf Pz.IV "Wirbelwind" - "Whirlwind"\n\nType: Anti-Aircraft Tank\nCrew: Five\nArmament: 4 Flak 38 L/65 guns of 20 mm caliber, 7.92 mm MG 34 machine-gun. \nAmmo: 3,200 shells; 1,350 rounds.\nArmor: front -50 mm, sides - 30 mm, rear - 20 mm, roof - 10 mm, bottom - 10 mm, turret - 16-25 mm.\nMax Speed: 38 km/h.\nRange: 200 km. \nEngine: Maybach HL 120TRM 300 HP (220.8kW), carburetor, liquid cooled.\nWeight: 22 tons\n\nThe prototype for the Wirbelwind anti-aircraft self-propelled gun was created in May 1944 and became the first true anti-aircraft tank. The prototype was constructed on the chassis of a battle-damaged PzIV that had been brought back for major repairs. The idea for the Wirbelwind  came from Karl Wilhelm Krause, an officer in the 12th SS Hitler Jugend tank division. In the summer of 1944, he suggested that a 4-barrel 20 mm Flak 38 L/65 gun be mounted on the Panzer IV chassis. Wirbelwind was equipped with specially developed nine-facet turrets, open on top. The turret was placed in the standard turret position on the Panzer IV. The Wirbelwind was armed with a 4-barrel 20 mm Flak 38 L/65 gun which could be used successfully against ground targets as well. A limited number of these anti-aircraft self-propelled guns were produced by the Ostbau Works in Sagan, Silesia. However, there was a lack of materials and Deutsche Eisenwerke had to be moved to Teplitz and Duisburg, to prevent them from being seized by the Red Army. All in all, 106 Wirbelwind anti-aircraft self-propelled guns were produced, starting from 1944. This variant on anti-aircraft self-propelled guns was sent to the tank divisions. There was always a lack of them and not all tank subdivisions on the fronts (who badly needed mobile air defense subdivisions) could be provided with them. These anti-aircraft tanks were extremely effective against low-flying air targets. 90 units of Wirbelwind anti-aircraft self-propelled guns were sent to the Eastern front, and 16 to the Western front.\n\nThe Wehrmacht military command was planning to increase the Wirbelwinds firepower. It was planned to re-equip available Wirbelwind SPAs at the end of 1944 with four 30 mm MK103/28 or MK103/38 guns capable of firing 1,600 rounds a minute. In December 1944, Ostbau produced only one prototype, named the Zerstorer 45 (Destroyer 45) - 3cm Flakvierling MK103/108 on Sfl PzKpfw IV.\n\nIn 1945 it was decided to use the chassis of the outdated Panzer III with a Wirbelwind turret mounted on it (marked as 2cm Flakvierling 38 on Slf Pz.Kpfw.III). The project was called Flakpanzer III. 90 tanks were ordered, but the end of the war brought the project to an end.\n
