m1_NAME                GAZ-M1 EMKA
m1_INFO                \n    GAZ-M1 "EMKA" Passenger car\n \nMax Speed: 100 km/h.\nFuel Capacity: 60 l.\nEmpty Weight: 1,370kg.\nEngine: GAZ-M, 50 HP (36.8kW), carburetor, liquid cooled.\nProduction year: 1936\n\nThe GAZ M-1 Passenger Car was based on a 1933 Ford model, the Ford-V8-40. On the outside, the "Emka" could be distinguished by its coating and wheels, but inside the V8 Ford engine was replaced by a GAZ-M, a copy of the Ford-BB motor. The letter M appears in the model index because the factory was named after Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR; the figure 1 stands for the model number.\n\nThe first three prototypes were assembled in January 1934. They looked like a Ford as far as coating and spoke wheels were concerned, and had small hatches instead of side cuts in the hood. Serial production started on March 17 1936. M-1 production was for the most part reduced in 1941, but assembling from a reserve of spare parts continued for some time. By June 20 1941, the Red Army had 10,500 Emkas. The total number of automobiles produced came to 62,888.\n\nThe Emka was the main command automobile in 1941-1942. Later on, this function was fulfilled by the Ford GP and GPW, Willys MA and MB.\n

gaz67_NAME             GAZ-67
gaz67_INFO             \n    Army car GAZ-67\n\nMax Speed: 90 km/h.\nFuel Capacity: 70 l\nEmpty Weight: 1,320kg\nEngine: GAZ-M, 50 HP (36.8kW), carburetor, liquid cooled.\nProduction year: 1941\n\nThis automobile was created in record time. Its first version, the GAZ-64, had simplified front wheels and notches enabling access to rear wheels, as in the Willis. The GAZ-67 differs from the GAZ-64 because it has a wider track. Since this car looked like the Willis, Soviet soldiers called them Ivan-Willis. The GAZ-67 also had modified versions: one with a rough upper part (the GAZ-67-420, only in 1944) and an amphibian version, the GAZ-011 (1945). \n\nTotal number of GAZ-67 automobiles produced: 4,851.\n\n

willis_NAME            Willys MB
willis_INFO            \n    Army car Willys MB \n\nMax Speed: 104 km/h (65 mph).\nFuel Capacity: 15 gallon\nWeight: 1,020kg.\nEngine:  73 HP (53.7kW), carburetor, liquid cooled.\nProduction year: 1940\n\nA light cross-country army vehicle, the Willys MB was created in 1940 in a very short time by three companies simultaneously: Willys, Ford and Bantam. Production started in 1941, but in July 1941 the American military department decided to combine these automobiles into one. The Willys MA was taken as the basic model, but it was also improved following maintenance experience. The new model was given the MB index. Ford started producing almost the same car under the name Ford GPW (the difference lay quite literally in the inscriptions on the bolts). The letter G stands for "Government issue" (state order), P for "Passenger" (the marking was used for tractors with a wheel base of 80 inches and carrying capacity of 1/4 tons) and W for Willys (produced to designs drawn up by the Willys company). The letters GP were for "jeep".\n\nFrom 1942, Willys vehicles were shipped to the USSR under the lend-lease program. 50,501 automobiles of this type were delivered to the USSR. The cars were used until the end of the Second World War.\n\n

zis5_NAME              ZIS-5 truck
zis5_INFO              \n    ZIS-5 truck \n\nMax Speed: 60 km/h.\nFuel Capacity: 70l.\nCarrying Capacity: 3 tons\nEmpty Weight: 3,100kg\nEngine: ZIS, 73 HP (53.7kW), carburetor, liquid cooled.\nProduction year: 1933\n\nThe ZiS-5 is the descendent of an American "Autocar" truck. In 1931, the AMO (Avtomobilnoye Moskovskoye Obschestvo: Moscow Automobile Society) factory was rebuilt and started assembling the new AMO-2 truck (which looked like the ZiS-5 on the outside). Some sets and units were supplied from abroad. Soon the AMO-2 was modernized and the AMO-3 and AMO-4 appeared. In 1933, the AMO factory underwent another major modernization and was renamed the ZiS (Zavod imeni Stalina: named after Stalin). Prototypes appeared in the su mmer of 1933 and, from October 1, serial production of the famous ZiS-5 started. Together with the GAZ-AA, the ZiS-5 became the main truck used by the USSR till the fifties.\n\nThe construction of the "three-ton truck", as it was called by the people, was classic for that time. It had a bearing frame, a leading back axle, spring suspension without shock absorbers, mechanical brake drive and wooden crew compartment upholstered with tin plates.\n\nThe total number of ZiS-5 cars produced was 83,000.\n

If need be, one could fire from it at light tanks and armored cars. High anti-aircraft gun mobility was ensured by the stationary mounting of the gun on the ZIS-5 truck chassis. Due to the ZIS-5s good carrying capacity (3 tons), it successfully fulfilled the role of a mobile base for anti-aircraft mounting.\n\nThe 25 mm anti-aircraft automatic gun on the ZIS-5 truck chassis was used till the end of World War II.\n  \n

ZIS6_fuel_NAME         ZIS-6 fuel truck
ZIS6_fuel_INFO         \n    Fuel Supply car on ZIS-6 chassis\n\nMax Speed: 55 km/h.\nInternal Fuel Capacity: 70 l\nCarrying Capacity: 3,200 l\nWeight: 4,230 kg\nEngine: ZIS, 73 HP (53.7kW), carburetor, liquid cooled.\nProduction year: 1937\n\nSerial production of the triaxial ZIS-6 truck was launched in 1937 at the Moscow factory named after Stalin, right after it had mastered production of the ZIS-5 truck. From the structural point of view, the ZIS-6 was a triaxial version of the ZIS-5 truck and was to a large extent unified with it.\n\nThree bridges gave the ZIS-6 good passability on wet, dirty roads, swampy soil, snow and sand.\n\nThe ZIS-6 chassis served as the basis for a Fuel Capacity car, which was produced from 1935 to 1941. It could simultaneously supply several vehicles with filtered fuel or transport fuel, and was used as a device for preparing fuel mixture using different types of fuel. \n\nFrom 1941, a simplified modification was produced, featuring an uncoated tank of larger size, square welded wings and a wood (not metal) upholstered crew compartment. \n

stud_NAME              US-6 Studebecker truck
stud_INFO              \n    US-6 "Studebecker" army truck\n\nMax Speed: 70 km/h.\nFuel Capacity: 150 l.\nWeight: 4,850 kg.\nEngine: Hercules JXD, 95 HP (69.9kW), carburetor, liquid cooled.\nCarrying capacity: 2.5 tons\nProduction year: 1941\n\nThe "Studebecker" was a vehicle with improved passability. The US-6 Studebecker was developed by the Studebecker company in 1941 when the government program for equipping land forces was implemented. The overall number of automobiles produced during World War II came to 197,000. The USSR received Studebeckers under the lend-lease program. Shipments amounted to about 100,000 automobiles.\n\nStudebeckers (or "Studers" as they were called) proved their worth as reliable and durable cars in battle conditions. These were cars with improved passability ensured by a powerful engine, three leading axes (wheel formula 6x6) and the high placement of all water-sensitive parts and mechanisms. Although their indicated carrying capacity was 2.5 tons, they successfully transported up to 5 tons on properly surfaced roads. However, unlike Soviet trucks, Studebeckers required fuel and lubrication of better quality.\n\n

studR_NAME             Rocket launcher
studR_INFO             \n    BM-13N Mobile Rocket Launcher using the "Studebecker" chassis as its basis\n\nMax Speed: 50 km/h.\nFuel Capacity: 70 l.\nWeight without shells: 7,100kg.\nArmament: 16 missiles M-13 (or M-20, M-30, M-13-UK) of 132 mm caliber.\nEngine: ZIS, 73 HP (53.7kW), carburetor, liquid cooled.\nProduction year: 1943\n\nBM-13 launchers were produced by several companies with varying production potential. This might explain why its construction went through more or less material modifications depending on the production methods adopted by the factory in question. This was the reason why a unified (standardized) BM-13N launcher was adopted in April 1943. While creating the mounting, the designers carried out a critical analysis of all units and details in an attempt to increase technological effectiveness and reduce costs. Like the BM-13, this battle car could fire M-13 missiles or the new improved M-20, M-30 and M-13-UK missiles (improved grouping).\n\nAn essential factor, which increased the tactical mobility of BM-13N-armed missile artillery units, was the use of a powerful American Studebecker US-6 truck shipped to the USSR under the lend-lease program as a launcher base.\n\nThe creation of this launcher led to the final completion of work on the "Katusha" BM-13 serial battle car, which took part in battles in this form till the end of the war.\n

katu_NAME              Katiusha
katu_INFO              \n    BM-13 "Katiusha" Mobile Rocket Launcher\n\nMax Speed: 50 km/h.\nFuel Capacity: 70 l\nWeight without shells: 7,200kg\nArmament: 16 M-13 missiles of 132 mm caliber.\nEngine: ZIS, 73 HP (53.7kW), carburetor, liquid cooled.\nProduction year: 1940\n\nAfter aviation adopted 82 mm RS-82 air-to-air missiles (1937) and 132 mm RS-132 air-to-surface missiles (1938), the main artillery department set the Reactive Scientific Research Institute the following challenge: a missile field salvo system was to be created based on the RS-132 missiles. The tactical/technical task was set in June 1938. By the summer of 1939, the Institute came up with a new 132 mm high-explosive fission-fragment shell marked M-13. In comparison with the aviation RS-132, the shell had larger flight range (8,470m) and a much more powerful battle unit (4.9kg). A self-propelled multiple-charge launcher was developed for the shell. Its first version was created on the model of the ZIS-5 truck and marked MU-1 (mechanized unit, first sample). It had 24 rocket rails mounted on a special frame. Trials conducted on proving grounds from December 1938 to February 1939 showed that the mounting did not fully meet requirements. The trial results were taken into consideration and a new MU-2 launcher was developed. The mounting was based on the ZIS-6 truck. It had 16 guides placed along the axis of the car with 16 missiles on them. All 16 missiles could be fired in 7 to 10 seconds. Based on the results of trials conducted on testing grounds, it was decided to adopt the mounting under the name BM-13.\n\nDuring the war, the first "Katushas" (battle cars for field missile artillery BM-13) were continuously undergoing various improvements based on front-line experience. In particular, launchers were mounted on more vehicles that were more powerful than ZIS-6 automobiles and had increased passability. \n\nThe BM-13 was successfully used on all fronts throughout World War II. \n

Loginov. It consists of a submachine gun with automatic anti-aircraft sight, mounting with laying mechanisms, balancing mechanism, shield protection and cart. Firing could be uninterrupted (automatic) or single. The barrel of the gun was equipped with an easily replaceable pipe, which had to be replaced if it became overheated from uninterrupted fire or in case of damage. A flame extinguisher was placed on the barrel to prevent gun layers from being blinded at shooting and to muffle the noise of the gun. Following the experience of using guns to shoot at ground targets (from 1943 on), the gun was equipped with a shield to protect gunner and gun from bullets and shell splinters.\n\nThe 25 mm automatic 72-K anti-aircraft gun was widely used by the Red Army for combating aircraft at distances of up to 2,400m and at altitudes of up to 2,000m. If need be, one could fire it at light tanks and armored cars.\n\nThe total number of 25 mm anti-aircraft guns (1942 model) supplied by the industry to the Red Army in the war years was 4,560 units.\n\n

Kalinin. There was very little time available to develop the new system, and this led to the placement of an 85 mm barrel on the platform of a 76 mm anti-aircraft gun (1938 model) and the use of its lock and automatic machinery.\n\nAfter undergoing test trials in 1939, the gun was perfected and adopted by the Red Army.\n\nIts construction peculiarities and the wide range of ammo developed and produced for it made this a suitable gun for shooting at air targets and enemy soldiers and destroying weapon emplacements and mobile armed targets.\n\nThe 85 mm anti-aircraft gun (1939 model) was extremely widely used in Red Army military units. Sub-divisions of these guns ensured protection of front-line units from the air and air-defense of administrative centers and industrial plants. They were adopted by anti-aircraft artillery divisions till the end of World War II.\n\n

minaP_INFO             \n    76 mm divisional gun ZIS-3, 1942 model\n\nCaliber: 76.2 mm\nInitial shell speed: 680 m/sec.\nRate of fire: up to 25 rounds/min.\nMax. shooting range: 13,290m\nDirect shot range: 820m\nWeight: 1,200 kg.\nProduction year: 1942\n\nThe new ZIS-3 gun project was started in late 1940 after successful trials of the 57 mm anti-tank ZIS-2 gun. It had the following configuration: a ZIS-2 gun carriage and modified F-22USV gun barrel with good ballistic characteristics, equipped with a dual brake for reducing gun-carriage load. In early 1941, the new gun - marked ZIS-3 - went through factory tests but was only adopted by the Red Army in 1942. \n\nThe Red Army had three ZIS-3 varieties at its disposal:\n - Gun with lock from 57 mm anti-tank gun with button sear.\n - Gun with simplified lock and lever sear, with 27 deg. elevation angle.\n - Gun with simplified lock, but with 37 deg. maximum elevation angle.\n\nThe 76.2 mm divisional gun, model 1942 (ZIS-3), was successfully used by the Red Army forces during the Second World War. The gun was rightly recognized by experts - including German experts - as one of the most brilliant constructions in the history of barrel artillery.\n

(322 km)\nEngine: 147 HP (109.6 kW) White 160AX 6-cylinder gas engine\nWeight: 20,000 lbs. (9,072 kg)\n\nFollowing Germany's Blitzkrieg across Europe, the Army recognized a need for highly mobile anti-tank units. In 1941, an ad-hoc solution was rushed into service with the pairing of a M1897A4 75mm gun (which differed little from the old French "Seventy-five" of World War I) on a slightly modified M3 half-track chassis.  \n\nSituated on a pedestal mount behind the driver's cab, the gun offered a limited firing arc over the front of the vehicle.  Early versions used the standard flat gunshield from the towed 75mm gun, but later versions carried a wrap-around shield offering superior protection for the gun crew.  Despite the age of the gun, the 75mm could still fire a shell at 2,000 ft/sec (610 m/sec) and pierce 3 in. (76.2 mm) of steel at 1,000 yards (914 m), offering respectable penetration for early in the war.  Unfortunately, the low velocity of the round made long-range accuracy difficult.  \n\nThe first conversions were raced to the Phillipines as the war in the Pacific began, but could do little to stem the invading Japanese Army.  Further experience with the M3 GMC in North Africa proved the type to be lacking in it's role as a tank-destroyer.  Unless the first shot hit home, the lightly armored M3 stood little chance in a duel with a tank. It's poor showing in Africa and later Sicily lead to the withdrawal of the M3 GMC from tank-destroyer units, and transfer to artillery roles.\n\nIn the Pacific, however, the M3 GMC--and other similar pairings of guns and howitzers with the M3 half-track--proved very successful as bunker-busters supporting Army and Marine units fighting tenaciously dug-in Japanese troops.\n\nConversions based on the later M3A1 half-track differed only in the mount used for the 75mm gun.\n\nBy 1944, the type was declared obsolete and replaced by newer designs like the M10 and M18 in tank-destoyer units.\n\n\n\n\n

Making extensive use of commercial, interchangeable components, the M2 and M3 and their derivatives were produced in the tens of thousands, with many supplied to Allied nations through Lend-Lease. The new half-tracks were in service by late-1941.\n\nThe basic M3 was armed with either a single .30 cal (7.62mm) MG or .50 cal (12.7mm) MG on a pedestal mount and carried a standard U.S. rifle squad cross-country with protection from small-arms fire and shrapnel.  The half-track allowed infantry units to keep pace with armored units at the frontlines, and proved an essential component of mobile warfare. However, the lack of overhead protection for occupants was a serious drawback of the design and would lead the U.S. military towards newer APC designs by the end of WWII.\n\nIn October of 1943, the standard M3 was replaced on the production lines by the M3A1 with improved defensive armament. Production of M3A1s reached 2,862 vehicles plus 1,360 M3 conversions.\n\nThe M2/M3 series provided the basis for a wide variety of special purpose vehicles, including mortar carriers, anti-aircraft platforms, anti-tank gun carriers and mobile howitzers.\n\n\n\n

The half-track chassis was developed specially for the Eastern front where increased demands were made regarding passability - demands which were not always met, even by full-driving automobiles. Instead of a back axle, a track trolley of the Carden-Loyd type was installed which was like the one used on the Pz.Kpfw.I tank. The leading axis was moved forward and the standard cardan shaft was replaced with a shorter one. In addition to the track trolley, brake levers were installed which acted on the rear axis brake drums. Thanks to this innovation, the Maultier could maneuver like a tank with the help of caterpillars.\n\nMaultier serial production was carried out by Ford, Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, Opel and Daimler-Benz with 4 main modifications. From 1942 to 1944 about 21,960 units were produced.\n\nMain modifications:\n\nSd.Kfz.3a - m.Gleisk. LKW 2t Maultier (Opel) - half-track Opel 3,6 - 36S/SSM truck.

However, its effectiveness was compromised by its limited maneuverability. In response to this problem, anti-aircraft guns were mounted on half-track Mule trucks in some military units. As a rule, these were 20 and 37 mm automatic Flak 30/38 and Flak 36 guns. These self-propelled anti-aircraft guns were a fairly effective means of fighting aircraft flying at low and medium altitude with a speed of up to 540-600 km/h, and light armored targets.\n\n

From April 1943 to March 1944, serial production continued of versions of a launcher and ammo transporting vehicle - the Munitinskraftwagen. Opel factories produced 296 self-propelled guns and 251 ammo-transporting vehicles.\n\nThe self-propelled gun represented a fully-armored half-track vehicle. A 10-barrel Nebelwerfer 41 missile launcher was placed in its rear part on a rotary armor dome ensuring a 360-degree horizontal pointing angle and a +45-degree vertical pointing angle. The firing range for a fission-fragment demolition mine weighing 34 to 36 kg was 7 km.\n\nThe self-propelled vehicle was created for increasing mobility and rate of fire, using a "six-barrel mortar" - the 150 mm Nebelwerfer 41. Some vehicles were armed with 80 mm (with 24 directing) R-Vielfachwerfer rocket salvo mountings used by the Waffen SS.\n\nThe vehicle for ammo transporting differed from the battle vehicle by the absence of a launcher.\n\n

From June 1939 to March 1945, 15,252 vehicles were produced.\n\nThe "Hanomag" was produced in 23 specialized variants that differed from each other in armament and equipment. The versions were marked with figures, e.g. Sd.Kfz.251/3 or Sd.Kfz.251/16. It is worth mentioning that a specialized version of the armored troop carrier could belong to any of the four modifications: the Sd.Kfz.251/3, for example, was produced on the basis of the Ausf.A or Ausf.D.\n\nSd.Kfz.251 armored troop-carriers were used by the Wehrmacht, SS troops and the Luftwaffe on all fronts till the end of the war. On March 1 1945, the troops had 6,540 units at their disposal. A small number of these cars were given to German allies - Romania, Hungary and Finland. The Trophy Sd.Kfz.251 (often rearmed) was used both by the Allies and the Red Army.\n\nAfter World War II, the modernized armored troop-carrier Sd.Kfz.251/1 Ausf.D was produced in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic for some time and was adopted by the Czechoslovak People's Army right into the eighties under the name OT-810.\n\n

minaL_NAME             88mm AA cannon
minaL_INFO             \n    88 mm anti-aircraft Flak 18 gun\n\nCaliber: 88 mm.\nInitial shell speed: 795-820 m/sec.\nRate of fire: 15-20 rounds./min.\nMax. shooting range: 12,000m.\nWeight: 5,000 kg.\nProduction year: 1928\n\nThis might well be the most famous gun of the Second World War. It was developed by Krupp in the town of Essen in cooperation with the Swedish company Bofors. Shipments to Wehrmacht anti-aircraft military units started in 1933.\n\nThe 88 mm Flak 18 gun was first used in battle conditions during the civil war in Spain. Several batteries of these guns were given to the German Condor legion and were used successfully, not only for fighting aircraft, but also against ground targets - primarily tanks. Learning from battle experience in Spain, armor-piercing and cumulative shells were developed for the 88 mm guns and these guns were designed for interaction with field troops and were equipped with a shield to protect gunners from gunfire as well as shell and bomb splinters. To increase the mobility of anti-aircraft guns used in anti-tank defense, they were placed on a tank chassis; thus these powerful 88 mm anti-tank self-propelled guns were created.\n\nThe 88 mm Flak 18 gun was constantly going through modifications and a whole family was produced during World War II - the Flak 18, Flak 36, Flak 37 and Flak 41. They are rightly judged to be formidable Wermacht weapons and were equally effective against aircraft, armored weapons and equipment and long-term weapon emplacements.\n

minaO_NAME             50mm Pak-38
minaO_INFO             \n    50 mm anti-tank Pak-38 gun\n\nCaliber: 50 mm.\nInitial shell speed: 549-1,180 m/sec.\nRate of fire: 12-14 rounds./min.\nMax. shooting range: 9,400 m.\nWeight: 1,000 kg.\nProduction year: 1938 \n\nThe Pak-38 guns were developed to replace an earlier 37 mm Pak-35/36 gun that had low armor piercing.\n\nIt was adopted while preparing the attack on the Soviet Union. Wehrmacht headquarters supposed that the Red Army had a large number of lightly armored tanks, but the appearance of the T-34 and KV tanks featuring anti-shell armor on the battlefield was an unpleasant surprise. The armor-piercing power of the Pak-38 gun turned out to be insufficient for fighting these tanks from long distances; it was thus replaced by a more powerful 75 mm gun. From the second half of 1944, the Pak-38 gun was mainly used only in training and occupation units.\n\n\n

minaN_NAME             150mm field howitzer
minaN_INFO             \n    150 mm heavy field howitzer, 1918 model\n\nCaliber: 150 mm\nInitial shell speed: 520 m/sec.\nRate of fire: 4-6 rounds./min.\nMax. shooting range: 13,325m.\nWeight: 5,512 kg.\nProduction year: 1918\n\nHeavy field howitzers (1918 model) were produced by Reinmetal and Krupp and were used to equip one of the four artillery regiment divisions of each infantry division (three four-gun batteries). The same howitzer was adopted by some heavy artillery divisions and used in main-thrust military operations.\n\n150 mm howitzers with a shooting range of 13,325m were widely used for combating artillery and destroying enemy tanks and soldiers on initial positions, destroying long-term weapon emplacements and shelling rear objects. The 150 mm heavy field howitzer (1918 model) was used by Wehrmacht military units throughout World War II and, according to expert opinion, excelled itself. To increase howitzer mobility, a self-propelled "Hummel" ("Bumblebee") gun was developed on the basis of the 1918 model. It was sent to the artillery regiments of tank divisions and SS troops.\n\nApart from the 150 mm heavy field howitzer (model 1918), the Wehrmacht used a vast and varied array of artillery guns from start to finish of the war.\n\n
